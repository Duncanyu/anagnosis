Example3 Find the tangent line at the point (1, 1, 2) to the curve defined by the parametric equation ⃗ 푟(푡) = 푡2⃗ 푖+ 푡3 ⃗ 푗+ 2푡⃗ 푘. Solution At time 푡= 1 the particle is at the point (1, 1, 2) with position vector ⃗ 푟0 = ⃗ 푖+ ⃗ 푗+ 2⃗ 푘. The velocity vector at time 푡is ⃗ 푟′(푡) = 2푡⃗ 푖+3푡2⃗ 푗+2⃗ 푘, so at time 푡= 1 the velocity is ⃗ 푣= ⃗ 푟′(1) = 2⃗ 푖+3⃗ 푗+2⃗ 푘. The tangent line passes through (1, 1, 2) in the direction of ⃗ 푣, so it has the parametric equation ⃗ 푟(푡) = ⃗ 푟0 + 푡⃗ 푣= (⃗ 푖+ ⃗ 푗+ 2⃗ 푘) + 푡(2⃗ 푖+ 3⃗ 푗+ 2⃗ 푘). The Acceleration Vector Just as the velocity of a particle moving in 2-space or 3-space is a vector quantity, so is the rate of change of the velocity of the particle, namely its acceleration. Figure 17.15 shows a particle at time 푡with velocity vector ⃗ 푣(푡) and then a little later at time 푡+ Δ푡. The vector Δ⃗ 푣= ⃗ 푣(푡+ Δ푡) −⃗ 푣(푡) is the change in velocity and points approximately in the direction of the acceleration. So, Average acceleration = Δ⃗ 푣 Δ푡.",0.0,-3.2382572

What is the formula for VACUOUS AND TRIVIAL PROOFS?,"474 C H A P T E R 1 4 Oligopoly: Firms in Less Competitive Markets accepts this contract, its profits will be $5 million per year, and Dell will earn $10 million in additional profits. If TruImage rejects the contract, its profits will be the $2 million per year it earns selling its software on its Web site, and Dell will earn zero additional profits. Now, suppose Dell offers TruImage a contract price of $20 per copy. If TruImage ac- cepts this contract, its profits will be $3 million per year, and Dell will earn $15 million in additional profits. If TruImage rejects this contract, its profits will be the $2 million it earns selling its software on its Web site, and Dell will earn zero additional profits. Clearly, for Dell, a contract price of $20 per copy is more profitable, while for TruImage, a contract price of $30 per copy is more profitable. Suppose TruImage attempts to obtain a favorable outcome from the bargaining by telling Dell that it will reject a $20-per-copy contract price. If Dell believes this threat, then it will offer TruImage a $30-per-copy contract price because Dell is better off with the $10 million profit that will result from TruImage’s accepting the contract than with the zero profits Dell will earn if TruImage rejects the $20-per-copy contract price. This result is a Nash equilibrium because neither firm can increase its profits by chang- ing its choice—provided that Dell believes TruImage’s threat. But is TruImage’s threat credible? Once Dell has offered TruImage the $20 contract price, TruImage’s choices are to accept the contract and earn $3 million or reject the contract and earn only $2 million. Because rejecting the contract reduces TruImage’s profits, TruImage’s threat to reject the contract is not credible, and Dell should ignore it. As a result, we would expect Dell to use the strategy of offering TruImage a $20-per- copy contract price and TruImage to use the strategy of accepting the contract. Dell will earn additional profits of $15 million per year, and TruImage will earn profits of $3 mil- lion per year. This outcome is called a subgame-perfect equilibrium. A subgame-perfect equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium in which no player can make himself or herself better off by changing his decision at any decision node. In our simple bargaining game, each player has only one decision to make. As we have seen, Dell’s profits are highest if it of- fers the $20-per-copy contract price, and TruImage’s profits are highest if it accepts the contract. Typically, in sequential games of this type, there is only one subgame-perfect equilibrium. Managers use decision trees like those in Figures 14.6 and 14.7 in business planning because they provide a systematic way of thinking through the implications of a strategy and of predicting the reactions of rivals. We can see the benefits of decision trees in the simple examples considered here. In the first example, Apple’s managers can conclude that charging a low price is more profitable than charging a high price. In the second example, Dell’s managers can conclude that TruImage’s threat to reject a $20-per-copy contract is not credible. The Five Competitive Forces Model We have seen that the number of competitors in an industry affects a firm’s ability to charge a price above average cost and earn an economic profit. The number of firms is not the only determinant of the level of competition in an industry, however.",0.0,-6.73717
State the 20.2 STOKES’ THEOREM.,"When you walk out into the sunlight, you feel warmth, but you do not feel any force from the sunlight. Sunlight is exerting a pressure on you, but that pressure is so small that you cannot notice it. Because the electromagnetic waves making up sunlight are radiated from the Sun and travel to the Earth, they are referred to as radiation. Chapter 18 discussed radiation as one way to transfer heat. As we’ll see in Chapter 40 on nuclear physics, this type of radiation is not necessarily the same as radioactive radiation resulting from the decay of unstable nuclei. However, radio waves, infrared waves, visible light, and X-rays are all fundamentally the same electromagnetic radiation. (Which is not to say, however, that all kinds of electromagnetic radiation have the same effect on the human body. For example, UV light can give you sunburn and even trigger skin cancer, whereas there is no credible evidence that radiation emitted from cell phones can cause cancer.) Let’s calculate the magnitude of the pressure exerted by these radiated electromagnetic waves. Electromagnetic waves carry energy, U, as shown in Section 31.4. Electromagnetic waves also have linear momentum, p. This concept is subtle because electromagnetic waves have no mass, and we saw in Chapter 7 that momentum is equal to mass multiplied by velocity. Maxwell showed that if a plane wave of radiation is totally absorbed by a surface (perpendicular to the direction of the plane wave) for a time interval, t, and an amount of energy, U, is absorbed by the surface in that process, then the magnitude of the momen- tum transferred to that surface by the wave in that time interval is   p U c = . Example 31.2 ​  The Root-Mean-Square Electric and Magnetic Fields from Sunlight The average intensity of sunlight at the Earth’s surface is approximately 1400 W/m2, if the Sun is directly overhead. Problem What are the root-mean-square electric and magnetic fields of these electromagnetic waves? Solution The intensity of sunlight can be related to the root-mean-square electric field using equa- tion 31.26: I c E = 1 . 0 rms 2  Solving for the root-mean-square electric field gives us E Ic = =",0.0,-3.9300015
What is the formula for S U B J E C T I N D E X?,"AI Wetiko This brings me to AI or artificial intelligence and something else Wetikos don’t want us to know. What is AI really? I know about computer code algorithms and AI that learns from data input. These, however, are more diversions, the expeditionary force, for the real AI that they want to connect to the human brain as promoted by Silicon Valley Wetikos like Kurzweil. What is this AI? It is the frequency of Wetiko, the frequency of the Archons. The connection of AI to the human brain is the connection of the Wetiko frequency to create a Wetiko hive mind and complete the job of assimilation. The hive mind is planned to be controlled from Israel and China which are both 100 percent owned by Wetiko Sabbatians. The assimilation process has been going on minute by minute in the ‘smart’ era which fused with the ‘Covid’ era. We are told that social media is scrambling the minds of the young and changing their personality. This is true, but what is social media? Look more deeply at how it works, how it creates divisions and conflict, the hostility and cruelty, the targeting of people until they are destroyed. That’s Wetiko. Social media is manipulated to tune people to the Wetiko frequency with all the emotional exploitation tricks employed by platforms like Facebook and its Wetiko front man, Zuckerberg. Facebook’s Instagram announced a new platform for children to overcome a legal bar on them using the main site. This is more Wetiko exploitation and manipulation of kids. Amnesty International likened the plan to foxes offering to guard the henhouse and said it was incompatible with human rights. Since when did Wetiko or Zuckerberg (I repeat myself) care about that? Would Brin and Page at Google, Wojcicki at YouTube, Bezos at Amazon and whoever the hell runs TwiĴer act as they do if they were not channelling Wetiko? Would those who are developing technologies for no other reason than human control? How about those designing and selling technologies to kill people and Big Pharma drug and ‘vaccine’ producers who know they will end or devastate lives?

State the THEOREM 7.,"BIENAYM ́ E’S FORMULA If X and Y are two independent random variables on a sample space S, then V(X + Y) = V(X) + V(Y). Furthermore, if Xi, i = 1, 2, ... , n, with n a positive integer, are pairwise independent random variables on S, then V(X1 + X2 + ⋯+ Xn) = V(X1) + V(X2) + ⋯+ V(Xn). Proof: From Theorem 6, we have V(X + Y) = E((X + Y)2) −E(X + Y)2. It follows that V(X + Y) = E(X2 + 2XY + Y2) −(E(X) + E(Y))2 = E(X2) + 2E(XY) + E(Y2) −E(X)2 −2E(X)E(Y) −E(Y)2. c ⃝Paul Fearn/Alamy Stock Photo IREN ́ EE-JULES BIENAYM ́ E (1796–1878) Bienaym ́ e, born in Paris, moved with his family to Bruges Links in 1803 when his father became a government administrator. Bienaym ́ e attended the Lyc ́ ee imp ́ erial in Bruges, and when his family returned to Paris in 1811, the Lyc ́ ee Louis-le-Grand. As a teenager, he helped defend Paris during the 1814 Napoleonic Wars; in 1815, he became a student at the ́ Ecole Polytech- nique. In 1816 he joined the Ministry of Finances to help support his family. In 1819, he left the civil service, taking a job lecturing mathematics at the Acad ́ emie militaire de Saint-Cyr. Unhappy with con- ditions there, he soon returned to the Ministry of Finances. He attained the position of inspector gen- eral, remaining until 1848, when he was forced to retire when a new regime installed their own peo- ple. He was able to return as inspector general in 1850, but he retired a second time in 1852. In 1851 he briefly was professor at the Sorbonne and also served as an expert statistician for Napoleon III. Bienaym ́ e was one of the founders of the Soci ́ et ́ e Math ́ ematique de France, and in 1875 was its president. Bienaym ́ e was noted for his ingenuity, but his papers frustrated readers by omitting important proofs. He published sparsely, often in obscure journals. However, he made important contributions to probability and statistics, and to their applications to the social sciences and to finance. Among his important contributions are the Bienaym ́ e-Chebyshev inequality, which provides a simple proof of the law of large numbers, a generalization of Laplace’s least square method, and Bienaym ́ e’s formula for the variance of a sum of random variables. He studied the extinction of aristocratic families, declining despite general population growth. Bienaym ́ e was a skilled linguist; he translated the works of Chebyshev, a close friend, from Russian to French. It has been suggested that his relative obscurity results from his modesty, his lack of interest in asserting the priority of his discoveries, and the fact that his work was often ahead of its time.",1.0,3.8734152
What is the formula for 2.1 Geometrical Shapes in Two Dimensions?,"I doubt the Cult intends it to go well. Yeadon said that you can put any gene you like into the body through the ‘vaccine’. ‘You can certainly give them a gene that would do them some harm if you wanted.’ I was intrigued when he said that when used in the cancer field the technique could turn genes on and off. I explore this process in The Answer and with different genes having different functions you could create mayhem – physically and psychologically – if you turned the wrong ones on and the right ones off. I read reports of an experiment by researchers at the University of Washington’s school of computer science and engineering in which they encoded DNA to infect computers. The body is itself a biological computer and if human DNA can inflict damage on a computer why can’t the computer via synthetic material mess with the human body? It can. The Washington research team said it was possible to insert malicious malware into ‘physical DNA strands’ and corrupt the computer system of a gene sequencing machine as it ‘reads gene leĴers and stores them as binary digits 0 and 1’. They concluded that hackers could one day use blood or spit samples to access computer systems and obtain sensitive data from police forensics labs or infect genome files. It is at this level of digital interaction that synthetic ‘vaccines’ need to be seen to get the full picture and that will become very clear later on. Michael Yeadon said it made no sense to give the ‘vaccine’ to younger people who were in no danger from the ‘virus’. What was the benefit? It was all downside with potential effects: The fact that my government in what I thought was a civilised, rational country, is raining [the ‘vaccine’] on people in their 30s and 40s, even my children in their 20s, they’re getting letters and phone calls, I know this is not right and any of you doctors who are vaccinating you know it’s not right, too. They are not at risk. They are not at risk from the disease, so you are now hoping that the side-effects are so rare that you get away with it. You don’t give new technology ... that you don’t understand to 100 percent of the population.

What is the formula for 7.2.4 Apply the formula for surface area to a volume generated by a parametric curve.?,"Now that we have introduced the concept of a parameterized curve, our next step is to learn how to work with this concept in the context of calculus. For example, if we know a parameterization of a given curve, is it possible to calculate the slope of a tangent line to the curve? How about the arc length of the curve? Or the area under the curve? Another scenario: Suppose we would like to represent the location of a baseball after the ball leaves a pitcher’s hand. If the position of the baseball is represented by the plane curve ⎛ ⎝x(t), y(t) ⎞ ⎠, then we should be able to use calculus to find the speed of the ball at any given time. Furthermore, we should be able to calculate just how far that ball has traveled as a function of time. Derivatives of Parametric Equations We start by asking how to calculate the slope of a line tangent to a parametric curve at a point. Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations x(t) = 2t + 3, y(t) = 3t −4, −2 ≤t ≤3. The graph of this curve appears in Figure 7.16. It is a line segment starting at (−1, −10) and ending at (9, 5). Figure 7.16 Graph of the line segment described by the given parametric equations.

This month, the supplies represent an asset (Supplies). Similar situ ations arise when a company prepays rent or insurance this month and uses up these assets in a later month. B. Cash with expense. Noodlecake has arranged to make automatic monthly payments to its utility company for electricity at the end of each month. Because the electricity is used up in the current month, it is an expense of the current month. C. Expense before, and cash after. Most businesses acquire goods or services on credit, so it is common for them to incur the expense of using up the benefits of goods or services in the current month, before paying for them in a later month. For example, Noodle cake places ads online but does not pay for this service until next month. Because the ads run in the current month, they are an expense that will be reported on this month’s income statement. Because the cost has not yet been paid at the end of the month, the balance sheet reports a corresponding liability called Accounts Payable. Similar situ ations arise when employees work in the current period but are not paid their wages until the following period. This period’s wages are reported as Salaries and Wages Expense on the income statement and any unpaid wages are reported as Salaries and Wages Payable on the balance sheet.

What is the formula for 21.6 Coulomb’s Law and Newton’s Law of Gravitation?,"Recall the algorithm for scheduling talks discussed in Example 7 of Section 3.1. The input to this algorithm is a group of m proposed talks with preset starting and ending times. The goal is to schedule as many of these lectures as possible in the main lecture hall so that no two talks overlap. Suppose that talk t j begins at time s j and ends at time e j. (No two lectures can proceed in the main lecture hall at the same time, but a lecture in this hall can begin at the same time another one ends.) Without loss of generality, we assume that the talks are listed in order of nondecreasing ending time, so that e1 ≤e2 ≤⋯≤em. The greedy algorithm proceeds by selecting at each stage a talk with the earliest ending time among all those talks that begin no sooner than when the last talk scheduled in the main lecture hall has ended. Note that a talk with the earliest end time is always selected first by the algorithm. We will show that this greedy algorithm is optimal in the sense that it always schedules the most talks possible in the main lecture hall. To prove the optimality of this algorithm we use mathematical induction on the variable n, the number of talks scheduled by the algorithm. We let P(n) be the proposition that if the greedy algorithm schedules n talks in the main lecture hall, then it is not possible to schedule more than n talks in this hall.",0.0,-9.253479

What is the formula for this rule?,"the sharp decline in consumption spending in 2008—the largest since 1980—occurred because falling housing prices resulted in lower housing wealth and lower consumer borrowing to finance spending. The debate over the effect of changes in housing wealth on consumption spending illustrates an important fact about macroeconomics: Many macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, housing prices, consumption spending, and investment spending, rise and fall at about the same time during the business cycle. Because many macroeconomic variables move together, economists sometimes have difficulty determining whether movements in one variable are causing movements in another variable. Based on Atif R.

(a) (b) h Figure 7.14 ​ Ballistic pendulum used in an introductory physics laboratory. However, the velocity change for the compact car is v = –9.77 m/s–(22.35 m/s)= –32.12 m/s. x compact, We obtain the corresponding average accelerations by dividing the velocity changes by the time interval, Δt, during which the collision takes place. This time interval is obviously the same for both cars, which means that the magnitude of the acceleration experienced by the body of the driver of the compact car is bigger than that experienced by the body of the driver of the SUV by a factor of 32.12/12.58 = 2.55. From this result alone, it is clear that it is safer to be in the SUV in this head-on collision than in the compact car. Keep in mind that this result is true even though Newton’s Third Law says that the forces exerted by the two vehicles on each other are the same (compare Example 4.5).

What is the formula for DNA BASE SEQUENCE : RNA BASE SEQUENCE : PROTEIN AMINO ACID SEQUENCE?,"Correctness M any mathematical statements assert that a property is true for all positive integers. Ex- amples of such statements are that for every positive integer n: n! ≤nn, n3 −n is divis- ible by 3; a set with n elements has 2n subsets; and the sum of the first n positive integers is n(n + 1)∕2. A major goal of this chapter, and the book, is to provide a thorough understanding of mathematical induction, which is used to prove results of this kind. Proofs using mathematical induction have two parts. First, they show that the statement holds for the positive integer 1. Second, they show that if the statement holds for a positive integer then it must also hold for the next larger integer. Mathematical induction is based on the rule of inference that tells us that if P(1) and ∀k(P(k) →P(k + 1)) are true for the domain of positive integers, then ∀nP(n) is true. Mathematical induction can be used to prove a tremendous variety of results. Understanding how to read and construct proofs by mathematical induction is a key goal of learning discrete mathematics. In Chapter 2 we explicitly defined sets and functions. That is, we described sets by listing their elements or by giving some property that characterizes these elements. We gave formu- lae for the values of functions. There is another important way to define such objects, based on mathematical induction. To define functions, some initial terms are specified, and a rule is given for finding subsequent values from values already known. (We briefly touched on this sort of definition in Chapter 2 when we showed how sequences can be defined using recurrence rela- tions.) Sets can be defined by listing some of their elements and giving rules for constructing elements from those already known to be in the set. Such definitions, called recursive defini- tions, are used throughout discrete mathematics and computer science. Once we have defined a set recursively, we can use a proof method called structural induction to prove results about this set. When a procedure is specified for solving a problem, this procedure must always solve the problem correctly. Just testing to see that the correct result is obtained for a set of input values does not show that the procedure always works correctly. The correctness of a procedure can be guaranteed only by proving that it always yields the correct result. The final section of this chapter contains an introduction to the techniques of program verification. This is a formal technique to verify that procedures are correct. Program verification serves as the basis for attempts under way to prove in a mechanical fashion that programs are correct. 5.1 Mathematical Induction 5.1.1 Introduction Suppose that we have an infinite ladder, as shown in Figure 1, and we want to know whether we can reach every step on this ladder.

The machines we analyzed in Chapter 4 were subject to the condition that the rope glides without friction over the pulley so that the pulley does not rotate (or, equivalently, that the pulley is massless). In such cases, the common acceleration of the two masses is a = g(m1 – m2)/(m1 + m2). With the concepts of rotational dynamics, we can take another look at the Atwood machine and consider the case where friction occurs between the rope and the pulley, causing the rope to turn the pulley without slipping. In Chapter 4, we saw that the magnitude of the tension, T, is the same everywhere in a string. However, now friction forces are involved to keep the string attached to the pulley, and we cannot assume that the tension is constant. Instead, the string ten- sion is separately determined in each segment of the string from which one of the two masses hang. Thus, there are two different string tensions, T1 and T2, in the free-body diagrams for the two masses (as shown in Figure 10.21b). Just as in Chapter 4, apply- ing Newton’s Second Law individually to each free-body diagram leads to –T m g m a 1 1 1 + = (10.20) T m g m a – = . 2 2 2 (10.21) Here again we used the (arbitrary) sign convention that a positive acceleration (a > 0) is one for which m1 moves downward and m2 upward. This convention is indicated in the free- body diagrams by the direction of the positive y-axis. Figure 10.21b also shows a free-body diagram for the pulley, but it includes only the forces that can cause a torque: the two string tensions, T1 and T2.",0.0,-4.6793394

But he records that, after the defeat, the Athenians themselves not only took against those who had advocated the expedition, but began to lose confidence in the way democracy made deci- sions. So they appointed a board of ten probouloi, men of experience who included the tragic poet Sophoklés, to give advice to Council and ekklesia. At the same time Athens faced new challenges. The loss of the fleet and of several thousand men presented Athens’ enemies with a remarkable oppor- tunity. Even before the final Athenian defeat in Sicily, Sparté had placed a permanent fort at Dekeleia in Attiké. This restricted Athenian freedom of movement all the year round, and the fort also became a sanctuary for runaway slaves, In particular, slaves fled from the silver mines at Laureion, reducing Athenian income from that source to a minimum, These were tough years for Athens. The citizens had to struggle to raise the funds to continue the war and to keep hold on their empire. They were forced to melt down gold statues and to draw on the 1,000 talents’ reserve which at the beginning of the war had been set aside for emergencies.

What is the formula for 26.4 Ammeters and Voltmeters?,"A device used to measure current is called an ammeter. A device used to measure potential difference is called a voltmeter. To measure the current, an ammeter must be wired in a circuit in series. Figure 26.17 shows an ammeter connected in a circuit in a way that allows it to measure the current i. To measure the potential difference, a voltmeter must be wired in parallel with the component across which the potential difference is to be measured. Figure 26.17 shows a voltmeter placed in the circuit to measure the potential drop across resistor R1. It is important to realize that these instruments must be able to make measurements while disturbing the circuit as little as possible. Thus, ammeters are designed to have as low a resis- tance as possible, usually on the order of 1 , so they do not have an appreciable effect on the currents they measure. Voltmeters are designed to have as high a resistance as possible, usually on the order of 10 M (107 ), so they have a negligible effect on the potential differences they are measuring. In practice, measurements of current and potential difference are made with a digital mul- timeter that can switch between functioning as an ammeter and functioning as a voltme- ter. It displays the results with a numerical digital display, which includes the sign of the potential difference or current. Most digital multimeters can also measure the resistance of a circuit component; that is, they can function as an ohmmeter. The digital multimeter performs this task by applying a known potential difference and measuring the resulting current. This test is useful for determining circuit continuity and the status of fuses, as well as measuring the resistance of resistors.

The complex ion has a central metal ion bonded to neutral and/or anionic ligands, which have one or more donor atoms that each have a lone pair of electrons. •  The most common coordination number of a metal ion in a complex ion is 6; thus, the most common complex-ion geometry is octahedral (six ligand atoms bonding). • Formulas and names of coordination compounds follow systematic rules. •  Coordination compounds can exhibit constitutional isomerism (coordination and linkage) and stereoisomerism (geometric and optical). 22.3 •  Theoretical Basis for the Bonding and Properties of Complexes In this section, we see that valence bond theory addresses how metal-ligand bonds form and why certain geometries are preferred, while a new model—crystal field theory—addresses why complexes are brightly colored and often paramagnetic. Applying Valence Bond Theory to Complex Ions Valence bond (VB) theory, which helped explain bonding and structure in main- group compounds (Section 11.1), is also used to describe bonding in complex ions. In the formation of a complex ion, the filled ligand orbital overlaps an empty metal- ion orbital: the ligand (Lewis base) donates an electron pair, and the metal ion (Lewis acid) accepts it to form a covalent bond in the complex ion (Lewis adduct) (Section 18.8). A bond in which one atom contributes both electrons is a coordinate covalent bond; once formed, it is identical to any covalent single bond. Recall that the VB concept of hybridization proposes mixing particular combi- nations of s, p, and d orbitals to obtain sets of hybrid orbitals, which have specific geometries. For coordination compounds, the model proposes that the type of metal- ion orbital hybridization determines the geometry of the complex ion. Let’s discuss orbital combinations that lead to octahedral, square planar, and tetrahedral geometries.

Note that for constructive interference and m = 0, we obtain  = 0°, which means that x = 0 and there is a bright fringe at 0°. This bright fringe is called the central maximum. The integer m determines the order of the fringe. The order has a different meaning for bright fringes and for dark fringes. For example, using equation 34.6 with m = 1 gives the angle of the first-order bright fringe, m = 2 gives the second-order bright fringe, and so on. Using equation 34.7 with m = 0 gives the angle of the first-order dark fringe, m = 1 gives the second-order dark fringe, etc. For both bright and dark fringes, the first-order fringe is the one closest to the central maximum.

Dr Michael Yeadon, former Vice President and Chief Scientific Advisor at Pfizer, and Dr Wolfgang Wodarg in Germany, filed a petition with the European Medicines Agency in December, 2020, urging them to stop trials for the Pfizer/BioNTech shot and all other mRNA trials until further studies had been done. They were particularly concerned about possible effects on fertility with ‘vaccine’-produced antibodies aĴacking the protein Syncytin-1 which is responsible for developing the placenta. The result would be infertility ‘of indefinite duration’ in women who have the ‘vaccine’ with the placenta failing to form. Section 10.4.2 of the Pfizer/BioNTech trial protocol says that pregnant women or those who might become so should not have mRNA shots. Section 10.4 warns men taking mRNA shots to ‘be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse’ and not to donate sperm. The UK government said that it did not know if the mRNA procedure had an effect on fertility. Did not know? These people have to go to jail. UK government advice did not recommend at the start that pregnant women had the shot and said they should avoid pregnancy for at least two months aĞer ‘vaccination’. The ‘advice’ was later updated to pregnant women should only have the ‘vaccine’ if the benefits outweighed the risks to mother and foetus. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Then ‘spontaneous abortions’ began to appear and rapidly increase on the adverse reaction reporting schemes which include only a fraction of adverse reactions. Thousands and ever-growing numbers of ‘vaccinated’ women are describing changes to their menstrual cycle with heavier blood flow, irregular periods and menstruating again aĞer going through the menopause – all links to reproduction effects.

Hence, by the product rule for counting, there are 2n (n−1) reflexive relations [this is the number of ways to choose whether each element (a, b), with a ≠b, belongs to R]. ◂ Formulas for the number of symmetric relations and the number of antisymmetric rela- tions on a set with n elements can be found using reasoning similar to that in Example 16 (see Exercise 49). However, no general formula is known that counts the transitive relations on a set with n elements. Currently, T(n), the number of transitive relations on a set with n elements, is known only for 0 ≤n ≤18. For example, T(4) = 3,994, T(5) = 154,303, and T(6) = 9,415,189. (The values of T(n) for n = 0, 1, 2, ... , 18, are the terms of the sequence A006905 in the OEIS, which is discussed in Section 2.4.)",1.0,-0.018908922

I know about computer code algorithms and AI that learns from data input. These, however, are more diversions, the expeditionary force, for the real AI that they want to connect to the human brain as promoted by Silicon Valley Wetikos like Kurzweil. What is this AI? It is the frequency of Wetiko, the frequency of the Archons. The connection of AI to the human brain is the connection of the Wetiko frequency to create a Wetiko hive mind and complete the job of assimilation. The hive mind is planned to be controlled from Israel and China which are both 100 percent owned by Wetiko Sabbatians. The assimilation process has been going on minute by minute in the ‘smart’ era which fused with the ‘Covid’ era. We are told that social media is scrambling the minds of the young and changing their personality. This is true, but what is social media? Look more deeply at how it works, how it creates divisions and conflict, the hostility and cruelty, the targeting of people until they are destroyed. That’s Wetiko. Social media is manipulated to tune people to the Wetiko frequency with all the emotional exploitation tricks employed by platforms like Facebook and its Wetiko front man, Zuckerberg. Facebook’s Instagram announced a new platform for children to overcome a legal bar on them using the main site. This is more Wetiko exploitation and manipulation of kids. Amnesty International likened the plan to foxes offering to guard the henhouse and said it was incompatible with human rights. Since when did Wetiko or Zuckerberg (I repeat myself) care about that? Would Brin and Page at Google, Wojcicki at YouTube, Bezos at Amazon and whoever the hell runs TwiĴer act as they do if they were not channelling Wetiko? Would those who are developing technologies for no other reason than human control?

Let P(n) be the assertion that at least n + 1 lines are needed to cover the lattice points in the given triangular region. Basis step: P(0) is true, because we need at least one line to cover the one point at (0, 0). Inductive step: Assume the inductive hypothesis, that at least k+1 lines are needed to cover the lattice points with x ≥0, y ≥0, and x + y ≤k. Consider the triangle of lattice points defined by x ≥0, y ≥0, and x + y ≤k + 1. By way of contradic- tion, assume that k + 1 lines could cover this set. Then these lines must cover the k + 2 points on the line x + y = k + 1. But only the line x + y = k + 1 itself can cover more than one of these points, because two distinct lines intersect in at most one point. Therefore, none of the k + 1 lines that are needed (by the inductive hypothesis) to cover the set of lattice points within the triangle but not on this line can cover more than one of the points on this line, and this leaves at least one point uncovered. Therefore, our assumption that k + 1 lines could cover the larger set is wrong, and our proof is complete. 33. Let P(n) be Bk = MAkM−1. Basis step: Part of the given conditions.

The work done is simply the difference between the final and initial kinetic energies.

What is the formula for this rule?,"111 4.6 Applying Newton’s Laws Inclined-plane problems, like the one we have just solved, are very common and pro- vide practice with component decomposition of forces. Another common type of problem involves redirection of forces via pulleys and ropes. The next solved problem shows how to proceed in a simple case. C A LC U L AT E Putting in the given value for the angle leads to a =(9.81 m/s )(sin22°)= 3.67489 m/s . x 2 2 R O U N D Because the angle of the slope was given to only two-digit accuracy, it makes no sense to give our result to a greater precision. The final answer is a = 3.7 m/s . x 2 D O U B L E - C H E C K The units of our answer, m/s2, are those of acceleration. The number we obtained is positive, which means a positive acceleration down the slope in the coordinate system we have chosen. Also the number is less than 9.81, which is comforting. It means that our calculated acceleration is less than that for free fall. As a final step, let’s check for consistency of our answer, ax = g sin , in limiting cases. In the case where  → 0°, the sine also converges to zero, and the acceleration vanishes. This result is consistent because we expect no acceleration of the snowboarder if he rests on a horizontal surface. As  → 90°, the sine approaches 1, and the acceleration is the acceleration due to gravity, as we expect as well. In this limiting case, the snowboarder would be in free fall. Solved Problem 4.2 ​ Two Blocks Connected by a Rope In this classic problem, a hanging mass causes the acceleration of a second mass that is resting on a horizontal surface (Figure 4.17a). Block 1, of mass m1 = 3.00 kg, rests on a horizontal fric- tionless surface and is connected via a massless rope (for simplicity, oriented in the horizontal direction) running over a massless pulley to block 2, of mass m2 = 1.30 kg. Problem What is the acceleration of block 1 and of block 2? Solution T h i n k From the figure, it is clear that block 1 can only move horizontally and that block 2 can only move vertically. Since the two blocks are connected by a rope, they exert a force on each other via the tension in the rope. Newton’s Third Law tells us that the magnitude of the tension acting on either block is the same. We also assume that the rope does not stretch appreciably. This means that any displacement of block 1 results in a displacement of equal magnitude of block 2. This also means that the blocks have the same speed at any time and thus their accelerations have the same magnitude, a. Finally, let’s think about the sign of the acceleration: If block 1 moves to the right, then block 2 moves down. It is important to note this consequence, because otherwise sign errors can creep into our calculations.",0.0,-2.9996264

Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions There are six inverse trigonometric functions. However, only three integration formulas are noted in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative versions of the ones we use. The only difference is whether the integrand is positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three more formulas, if the integrand is negative, simply factor out −1 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas already provided. To close this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent function. 614 Chapter 5 | Integration This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",1.0,0.8190121
What is the formula for 8.6 Experimental Results?,"In this section, we apply the complete forward pruning (CFP) algorithm developed in Section 8.1 and the domain-independent pruning heuristics proposed in Section 8.2, plus the modified rule of Section 8.2 if neces- sary, to three NP-hard [35] combinatorial optimization problems, maximal boolean satisfiability [35] and the symmetric and asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems [85]. The purpose of this study is to examine the anytime feature of complete forward pruning and the effectiveness of the domain-independent pruning rule. In our experiments, we compare com- plete forward pruning's performance profile, defined in (8.1), against that of depth-first branch-and-bound. 8. 6.1 Maximum boolean satisfiability We are concerned with boolean 3-satisfiability (3-SAT), a constraint- satisfaction problem (CSP). A 3-SAT involves a set of boolean variables, and a conjunction of sets of disjunctive clauses of three literals each (variables and their negations) that defines constraints of acceptable com- binations of variables. There are many practical constraint-satisfaction problems in which no value assignment can be found that does not vio- late a constraint; see [32] for discussion and references therein.~In this case, one option is to find an assignment such that the total number of satisfied clauses is maximized. In our experiment, we consider maximum boolean 3-SAT. Maximum boolean 3-SAT can be optimally solved by the Davis-Putnam algorithm [23], which can be organized as depth-first branch-and-bound in the following way. The root of the search tree is the original problem with no variable specified. One variable is then chosen and set to either true or false, thus decomposing the original problem into two subproblems. Each",1.0,3.1428692

What is the formula for LO 1-2?,"Three undirected graphs. does have an Euler path from a to b, but not an Euler circuit. The first edge of the path contributes one to the degree of a. A contribution of two to the degree of a is made every time the path passes through a. The last edge in the path contributes one to the degree of b. Every time the path goes through b there is a contribution of two to its degree. Consequently, both a and b have odd degree. Every other vertex has even degree, because the path contributes two to the degree of a vertex whenever it passes through it. Now consider the converse. Suppose that a graph has exactly two vertices of odd degree, say a and b. Consider the larger graph made up of the original graph with the addition of an edge {a, b}. Every vertex of this larger graph has even degree, so there is an Euler circuit. The removal of the new edge produces an Euler path in the original graph. Theorem 2 summarizes these results.",0.0,-5.3243685
What is the formula for this rule?,"Saturated Hydrocarbons and Trees Graphs can be used to represent molecules, where atoms are represented by vertices and bonds between them by edges. The English mathemati- cian Arthur Cayley discovered trees in 1857 when he was trying to enumerate the isomers of compounds of the form CnH2n+2, which are called saturated hydrocarbons. (Isomers represent compounds with the same chemical formula but different chemical properties.) In graph models of saturated hydrocarbons, each carbon atom is represented by a vertex of degree 4, and each hydrogen atom is represented by a vertex of degree 1. There are 3n + 2 vertices in a graph representing a compound of the form CnH2n+2. The number of edges in such a graph is half the sum of the degrees of the vertices. Hence, there are (4n + 2n + 2)∕2 = 3n + 1 edges in this graph. Because the graph is connected and the number of edges is one less than the number of vertices, it must be a tree (see Exercise 15). The nonisomorphic trees with n vertices of degree 4 and 2n + 2 of degree 1 represent the different isomers of CnH2n+2. For instance, when n = 4, there are exactly two nonisomorphic trees of this type (the reader should verify this). Hence, there are exactly two different isomers of C4H10. Their structures are displayed in Figure 9. These two isomers are called butane and isobutane (also known as i-butane or methylpropane). ◂",0.0,-1.910104

From the result in part a. the third-order Maclaurin polynomial is p3 (x) = 1 + 1 2x −1 8x2 + 1 16x3. Therefore, 1.5 = 1 + 0.5 ≈1 + 1 2(0.5) −1 8(0.5)2 + 1 16(0.5)3 ≈1.2266. From Taylor’s theorem, the error satisfies R3 (0.5) = f (4)(c) 4! (0.5)4 for some c between 0 and 0.5. Since f (4)(x) = − 15 24 (1 + x)7/2, and the maximum value of |f (4)(x)| on the interval (0, 0.5) occurs at x = 0, we have |R3 (0.5)| ≤15 4!24(0.5)4 ≈0.00244.

Example 5.4 Approximating the Area Under a Curve Use both left-endpoint and right-endpoint approximations to approximate the area under the curve of f(x) = x2 on the interval [0, 2]; use n = 4. Solution First, divide the interval [0, 2] into n equal subintervals. Using n = 4, Δx = (2 −0) 4 = 0.5. This is the width of each rectangle. The intervals ⎡ ⎣0, 0.5 ⎤ ⎦, ⎡ ⎣0.5, 1 ⎤ ⎦, ⎡ ⎣1, 1.5 ⎤ ⎦, ⎡ ⎣1.5, 2 ⎤ ⎦are shown in Figure 5.6. Using a left-endpoint approximation, the heights are f(0) = 0, f(0.5) = 0.25, f(1) = 1, f(1.5) = 2.25. Then, L4 = f(x0)Δx + f(x1)Δx + f(x2)Δx + f(x3)Δx = 0(0.5) + 0.25(0.5) + 1(0.5) + 2.25(0.5) = 1.75. Figure 5.6 The graph shows the left-endpoint approximation of the area under f(x) = x2 from 0 to 2. The right-endpoint approximation is shown in Figure 5.7. The intervals are the same, Δx = 0.5, but now use the right endpoint to calculate the height of the rectangles.

By moving objects on a circular path, this centrifuge creates artif cial gravity forces up to twenty times stronger than what we experience on Earth. In this chapter, we study circular motion and see how force is involved in making turns, which will let us understand how NASA’s 20g centrifuge works. T is discussion relies on concepts of force, velocity, and acceleration presented in Chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 10 will combine these ideas with some of the con- cepts from Chapters 5 through 8, such as energy and momentum. Much of what you will learn in these two chapters on circular motion and rotation is analogous to earlier material on linear motion, force, and energy. Because most objects do not travel in perfectly straight lines, the concepts of circular motion will be applied many times in later chapters.

What is the formula for 14.8 DIFFERENTIABILITY?,"Suppose that am,n is defined recursively for (m, n) ∈N × N by a0,0 = 0 and am,n = { am−1,n + 1 if n = 0 and m > 0 am,n−1 + n if n > 0. Show that am,n = m + n(n + 1)∕2 for all (m, n) ∈N × N, that is, for all pairs of nonnegative integers. Solution: We can prove that am,n = m + n(n + 1)∕2 using a generalized version of mathematical induction. The basis step requires that we show that this formula is valid when (m, n) = (0, 0). The induction step requires that we show that if the formula holds for all pairs smaller than (m, n) in the lexicographic ordering of N × N, then it also holds for (m, n). BASIS STEP: Let (m, n) = (0, 0). Then by the basis case of the recursive definition of am,n we have a0,0 = 0. Furthermore, when m = n = 0, m + n(n + 1)∕2 = 0 + (0 ⋅1)∕2 = 0.

What is the formula for this rule?,"years. The U.S. government grants patents to companies that develop new products or new ways of making existing products. A patent gives a firm the exclusive legal right to a new product for a pe- riod of 20 years from the date a patent on the product is applied for. For example, a pharmaceutical firm that develops a drug that cures cancer can secure a patent on the drug, keeping other firms from manufacturing the drug without permission. The profits earned during the period the patent is in force provide firms with an incentive for undertaking the research and development. The patent system has drawbacks, however. In filing for a patent, a firm must disclose information about the product or process. This information enters the public record and may help competing firms develop products or processes that are similar but that do not infringe on the patent. To avoid this problem, a firm may try to keep the results of its research a trade secret, without patenting it. (A famous example of a trade secret is the formula for Coca- Cola.) Tension also arises between the government’s objectives of providing patent protection that gives firms the incentive to engage in research and development and making sure that the knowledge gained through the research is widely available, which increases the positive effect of the knowledge on the economy. Economists debate the features of an ideal patent system.

What is the formula for 294 Chapter 9 • Models of Chemical Bonding?,"closer to F. This unequal sharing makes the F end of the bond partially negative and the H end partially positive. The electrostatic attraction between these partial charges increases the energy required to break the bond. From studies with many other com- pounds, Pauling derived a scale of relative EN values based on fluorine having the highest EN value, 4.0 (Figure 9.19). T rends in Electronegativity ​ Because the nucleus of a smaller atom is closer to the shared pair than that of a larger atom, it attracts the bonding electrons more strongly. So, in general, electronegativity is inversely related to atomic size. Thus, for the main- group elements, electronegativity generally increases up a group and across a period. Electronegativity and Oxidation Number ​ An important use of electronegativity is in determining an atom’s oxidation number (O.N.; see Section 4.5): 1.  The more electronegative atom in a bond is assigned all the shared electrons; the less electronegative atom is assigned none. 2. Each atom in a bond is assigned all of its unshared electrons. 3. The oxidation number is given by O.N. 5 no. of valence e2 2 (no. of shared e2 1 no. of unshared e2) In HCl, for example, Cl is more electronegative than H. Cl has 7 valence electrons and is assigned 8 (2 shared 1 6 unshared), so its O.N. is 7 2 8 5 21. The H atom has 1 valence electron and is assigned none, so its O.N. is 1 2 0 5 11. Bond Polarity and Partial Ionic Character Whenever atoms of different electronegativities form a bond, such as H (2.1) and F (4.0) in HF, the bonding pair is shared unequally. This unequal distribution of elec- tron density results in a polar covalent bond. It is depicted by a polar arrow (± ± £) pointing toward the partially negative pole or by d1 and d2 symbols (see Figure 4.1): or F H F H ± ± £ Figure 9.19 The Pauling electronegativ- ity (EN) scale.

What is the formula for this rule?,"The Maximum Value of a Function In many areas of science, engineering, and mathematics, it is useful to know the maximum value a function can obtain, even if we don’t know its exact value at a given instant. For instance, if we have a function describing the strength of a roof beam, we would want to know the maximum weight the beam can support without breaking. If we have a function that describes the speed of a train, we would want to know its maximum speed before it jumps off the rails. Safe design often depends on knowing maximum values. This project describes a simple example of a function with a maximum value that depends on two equation coefficients. We will see that maximum values can depend on several factors other than the independent variable x. 1. Consider the graph in Figure 1.42 of the function y = sinx + cosx. Describe its overall shape. Is it periodic? How do you know? Figure 1.42 The graph of y = sinx + cosx. Using a graphing calculator or other graphing device, estimate the x - and y -values of the maximum point for the graph (the first such point where x > 0). It may be helpful to express the x -value as a multiple of π. 2. Now consider other graphs of the form y = Asinx + Bcosx for various values of A and B. Sketch the graph when A = 2 and B = 1, and find the x - and y-values for the maximum point. (Remember to express the x-value as a multiple of π, if possible.) Has it moved? 3.

What is the formula for CHAPTER 5?,"There are simple criteria for determining whether a multigraph has an Euler circuit or an Euler path. Euler discovered them when he solved the famous K ̈ onigsberg bridge problem. We will assume that all graphs discussed in this section have a finite number of vertices and edges. What can we say if a connected multigraph has an Euler circuit? What we can show is that every vertex must have even degree. To do this, first note that an Euler circuit begins with a vertex a and continues with an edge incident with a, say {a, b}. The edge {a, b} contributes one to deg(a). Each time the circuit passes through a vertex it contributes two to the vertex’s degree, because the circuit enters via an edge incident with this vertex and leaves via another such edge. Finally, the circuit terminates where it started, contributing one to deg(a). There- fore, deg(a) must be even, because the circuit contributes one when it begins, one when it ends, and two every time it passes through a (if it ever does). A vertex other than a has even de- gree because the circuit contributes two to its degree each time it passes through the vertex. We conclude that if a connected graph has an Euler circuit, then every vertex must have even degree. Is this necessary condition for the existence of an Euler circuit also sufficient? That is, must an Euler circuit exist in a connected multigraph if all vertices have even degree? This question can be settled affirmatively with a construction. Suppose that G is a connected multigraph with at least two vertices and the degree of every vertex of G is even. We will form a simple circuit that begins at an arbitrary vertex a of G, building it edge by edge. Let x0 = a. First, we arbitrarily choose an edge {x0, x1} inci- dent with a which is possible because G is connected. We continue by building a simple path {x0, x1}, {x1, x2}, ... , {xn−1, xn}, successively adding edges one by one to the path until we can- not add another edge to the path. This happens when we reach a vertex for which we have already included all edges incident with that vertex in the path. For instance, in the graph G in Figure 5 we begin at a and choose in succession the edges {a, f}, { f, c}, {c, b}, and {b, a}. The path we have constructed must terminate because the graph has a finite number of edges, so we are guaranteed to eventually reach a vertex for which no edges are available to add to the path. The path begins at a with an edge of the form {a, x}, and we now show that it must terminate at a with an edge of the form {y, a}. To see that the path must terminate at a, note that each time the path goes through a vertex with even degree, it uses only one edge to enter c ⃝INTERFOTO/Alamy Stock Photo LEONHARD EULER (1707–1783) Leonhard Euler was the son of a Calvinist minister from the vicinity of Links Basel, Switzerland.

What is the formula for this rule?,"So far, we have learned how to differentiate a variety of functions, including trigonometric, inverse, and implicit functions. In this section, we explore derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions. As we discussed in Introduction to Functions and Graphs, exponential functions play an important role in modeling population growth and the decay of radioactive materials. Logarithmic functions can help rescale large quantities and are particularly helpful for rewriting complicated expressions. Derivative of the Exponential Function Just as when we found the derivatives of other functions, we can find the derivatives of exponential and logarithmic functions using formulas. As we develop these formulas, we need to make certain basic assumptions. The proofs that these assumptions hold are beyond the scope of this course. First of all, we begin with the assumption that the function B(x) = bx, b > 0, is defined for every real number and is continuous. In previous courses, the values of exponential functions for all rational numbers were defined—beginning with the definition of bn, where n is a positive integer—as the product of b multiplied by itself n times. Later, we defined b0 = 1, b−n = 1 bn, for a positive integer n, and bs/t = ( b t )s for positive integers s and t. These definitions leave open the question of the value of br where r is an arbitrary real number. By assuming the continuity of B(x) = bx, b > 0, we may interpret br as lim x →rbx where the values of x as we take the limit are rational. For example, we may view 4π as the number satisfying 43 < 4π < 44, 43.1 < 4π < 43.2, 43.14 < 4π < 43.15, 43.141 < 4π < 43.142, 43.1415 < 4π < 43.1416 ,....

(x2 + xy + x log y)3 < (3x2y3) = 27x6y3 for x > 1 and y > 1, because x2 < x2y, xy < x2y, and x log y < x2y. Hence, (x2 + xy + x log y)3 is O(x6y3). 55. For all positive real numbers x and y, ⌊xy⌋≤xy.

Here repeated ap- plications of L’Hˆ opital’s rule shows that limx→∞xd∕bx = 0 and limx→∞bx∕xd = ∞. 61. To show that cn is O(n!), assume WLOG that c is an integer greater than 1. Claim that if n ≥c2+c, then n! ≥cn. Both n! and cn have n factors. Replac- ing each of the factors from c2 + 1 to c2 + c in n! by c2 only makes the product smaller. But then each of these factors c2 can be factored as c ⋅c and one of those factors of c moved to pair with the factors 1 through c in n!. At this point every fac- tor of n! is greater than or equal to c, so the product is greater than or equal to cn. To show that n! is not O(cn), look at the ra- tio n!∕cn and write this as (c!∕cc)⋅((c+1)∕c)⋅((c+2)∕c)⋅((c+ 3)∕c) ⋯((2c)∕c)⋅((2c+1)∕c) ⋯(n∕c). Treat the product of the",0.0,-4.929286

State the THEOREM 4.,"The acceleration due to the gravitational force is constant, to a good approximation, near the surface of Earth. If this statement is true, it must have observable consequences. Let’s assume it is true and work out the consequences for the motion of objects under the influ- ence of Earth’s gravitational attraction. Then we’ll compare our results with experimental observations and see if constant acceleration due to gravity makes sense. The acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the Earth has the value g = 9.81 m/s2. We call the vertical axis the y-axis and define the positive direction as up. Then the accelera- tion vector a has only a nonzero y-component, which is given by a g y =– . (2.24) This situation is a specific application of motion with constant acceleration, which we dis- cussed earlier in this section.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Initial-value problems arise in many applications. Next we consider a problem in which a driver applies the brakes in a car. We are interested in how long it takes for the car to stop. Recall that the velocity function v(t) is the derivative of a position function s(t), and the acceleration a(t) is the derivative of the velocity function. In earlier examples in the text, we could calculate the velocity from the position and then compute the acceleration from the velocity. In the next example we work the other way around. Given an acceleration function, we calculate the velocity function. We then use the velocity function to determine the position function. Example 4.54 Decelerating Car A car is traveling at the rate of 88 ft/sec (60 mph) when the brakes are applied. The car begins decelerating at a constant rate of 15 ft/sec2. a. How many seconds elapse before the car stops? b. How far does the car travel during that time? Solution a. First we introduce variables for this problem. Let t be the time (in seconds) after the brakes are first applied. Let a(t) be the acceleration of the car (in feet per seconds squared) at time t. Let v(t) be the velocity of the car (in feet per second) at time t. Let s(t) be the car’s position (in feet) beyond the point where the brakes are applied at time t. The car is traveling at a rate of 88 ft/sec. Therefore, the initial velocity is v(0) = 88 ft/sec. Since the car is decelerating, the acceleration is a(t) = −15 ft/s2. The acceleration is the derivative of the velocity, v′(t) = 15. Therefore, we have an initial-value problem to solve: v′(t) = −15, v(0) = 88. Integrating, we find that v(t) = −15t + C. Since v(0) = 88, C = 88. Thus, the velocity function is v(t) = −15t + 88. To find how long it takes for the car to stop, we need to find the time t such that the velocity is zero. Solving −15t + 88 = 0, we obtain t = 88 15 sec. b. To find how far the car travels during this time, we need to find the position of the car after 88 15 sec. We know the velocity v(t) is the derivative of the position s(t). Consider the initial position to be s(0) = 0. Therefore, we need to solve the initial-value problem s′(t) = −15t + 88, s(0) = 0. 500 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",0.0,-3.0250385

The results are the same whether we use Equation 3.5 or Equation 3.6. For f(x) = x2 + 3x + 2, find f′(1). Velocities and Rates of Change Now that we can evaluate a derivative, we can use it in velocity applications. Recall that if s(t) is the position of an object moving along a coordinate axis, the average velocity of the object over a time interval [a, t] if t > a or [t, a] if t < a is given by the difference quotient (3.7) vave = s(t) −s(a) t −a . As the values of t approach a, the values of vave approach the value we call the instantaneous velocity at a. That is, instantaneous velocity at a, denoted v(a), is given by (3.8) v(a) = s′(a) = lim t →a s(t) −s(a) t −a . To better understand the relationship between average velocity and instantaneous velocity, see Figure 3.8. In this figure, the slope of the tangent line (shown in red) is the instantaneous velocity of the object at time t = a whose position at time t is given by the function s(t). The slope of the secant line (shown in green) is the average velocity of the object over the time interval [a, t]. 224 Chapter 3 | Derivatives This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",1.0,2.1299176

To get 푤푖in terms of h푖, we use the Pythagorean Theorem in Figure 8.4: h2 푖+ (푤푖 2 )2 = 72, so 푤푖= √ 4(72 −h2 푖) = 2 √ 49 −h2 푖.

What is the formula for 4.4 Newton’s Laws?,"So far this chapter has introduced several types of forces without really explaining how they work and how we can deal with them. The key to working with forces involves understand- ing Newton’s laws. We discuss these laws in this section and then present several examples showing how they apply to practical situations. Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was perhaps the most influential scientist who ever lived. He is generally credited with being the founder of modern mechanics, as well as calculus (along with the German mathematician Gottfried Leibniz). The first few chapters of this book are basically about Newtonian mechanics. Although he formulated his three famous laws in the 17th century, these laws are still the foundation of our understanding of forces. To begin this discussion, we simply list Newton’s three laws, published in 1687. Newton’s First Law: If the net force on an object is equal to zero, the object will remain at rest if it was at rest. If it was moving, it will remain in motion in a straight line with the same constant velocity. Newton’s Second Law: If a net external force, Fnet, acts on an object with mass m, the force will cause an acceleration, a, in the same direction as the force: F ma net = . Newton’s Third Law: The forces that two interacting objects exert on each other are always exactly equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: F F 1 2 2 1 → → =– . Newton’s First Law The earlier discussion of net force mentioned that zero net external force is the necessary condition for an object to be at rest. We can use this condition to find the magnitude and direction of any unknown forces in a problem. That is, if we know that an object is at rest and we know its weight force, then we can use the condition F net =0 to solve for other forces acting on the object. This kind of analysis led to the magnitude and direction of the force N in the example of the laptop computer being held at rest. We can use this way of thinking as a general principle: If object 1 rests on object 2, then the normal force N equal to the object’s weight keeps object 1 at rest, and therefore the net Self-Test Opportunity 4.1 Draw the free-body diagrams for a golf ball resting on a tee, your car parked on the street, and you sitting on a chair.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Present and Future Value Concepts The concepts of present value (PV) and future value (FV) are based on the time value of money. The time value of money is the idea that, quite simply, money received today is worth more than money to be received one year from today (or at any other future date) because it can be used to earn interest. If you invest $1,000 today at 10 percent, you will have $1,100 in one year. So $1,000 in one year is worth $100 less than $1,000 today because you lose the opportunity to earn the $100 in interest. In some business situations, you will know the dollar amount of a cash flow that occurs in the future and will need to determine its value now. This type of situation is known as a present value problem. The opposite situation occurs when you know the dollar amount of a cash flow that occurs today and need to determine its value at some point in the future. These situations are called future value problems. The value of money changes over time because money can earn interest. The following table illustrates the basic difference between present value and future value problems:",0.0,-4.338016

The victims were slaughtered at the great altar of Athéné on the Akropolis.

His mother, Alice Lena Cole, was Links a poet, and his father, Gustav Adolph Kleene, was an economics professor. Kleene attended Amherst College and received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1934, where he studied under the famous logician Alonzo Church. Kleene joined the faculty of the University of Wisconsin in 1935, where he remained except for several leaves, including stays at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. During World War II he was a navigation instructor at the Naval Reserve’s Midshipmen’s School and later served as the director of the Naval Research Laboratory. Kleene made significant contributions to the theory of recursive functions, investigating questions of computability and decidability, and proved one of the central results of automata theory. He served as the Acting Director of the Mathematics Research Center and as Dean of the College of Letters and Sciences at the University of Wisconsin. Kleene was a student of natural history.

Barter trade occurs only if there is a double coin- cidence of wants, where both parties to the trade want what the other one has. Because barter is inefficient, there is strong incen- tive to use money, which is any asset that people are generally willing to accept in exchange for goods or services or in payment of debts. An asset is anything of value owned by a person or a firm. A commodity money is a good used as money that also has value independent of its use as money. Money has four functions: It is a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a standard of deferred payment. The gold standard was a monetary system under which the government produced gold coins and pa- per currency that were convertible into gold. The gold standard collapsed in the early 1930s. Today, no government in the world issues paper currency that can be redeemed for gold. Instead, pa- per currency is fiat money, which has no value except as money.

What is the formula for this rule?,"ensure that they follow the globally-dictated Cult agenda. These networks were the means through which the ‘Covid’ hoax could be played out with almost every country responding in the same way. The ‘Yessir’ pyramid Compartmentalisation is the key to understanding how a tiny few can dictate the lives of billions when combined with a top-down sequence of imposition and acquiescence. The inner core of the Cult sits at the peak of the pyramidal hierarchy of human society (Fig 2 overleaf). It imposes its will – its agenda for the world – on the level immediately below which acquiesces to that imposition. This level then imposes the Cult will on the level below them which acquiesces and imposes on the next level. Very quickly we meet levels in the hierarchy that have no idea there even is a Cult, but the sequence of imposition and acquiescence continues down the pyramid in just the same way. ‘I don’t know why we are doing this but the order came from “on-high” and so we beĴer just do it.’ Alfred Lord Tennyson said of the cannon fodder levels in his poem The Charge of the Light Brigade: ‘Theirs not to reason why; theirs but to do and die.’ The next line says that ‘into the valley of death rode the six hundred’ and they died because they obeyed without question what their perceived ‘superiors’ told them to do. In the same way the population capitulated to ‘Covid’. The whole hierarchical pyramid functions like this to allow the very few to direct the enormous many. Eventually imposition-acquiescence-imposition-acquiescence comes down to the mass of the population at the foot of the pyramid. If they acquiesce to those levels of the hierarchy imposing on them (governments/law enforcement/doctors/media) a circuit is completed between the population and the handful of super- psychopaths in the Cult inner core at the top of the pyramid. Without a circuit-breaking refusal to obey, the sequence of imposition and acquiescence allows a staggeringly few people to impose their will upon the entirety of humankind. We are looking at the very sequence that has subjugated billions since the start of 2020. Our freedom has not been taken from us. Humanity has given it",0.0,-4.145427

What is the formula for this rule?,"In this section, we explore integrals containing expressions of the form a2 −x2, a2 + x2, and x2 −a2, where the values of a are positive. We have already encountered and evaluated integrals containing some expressions of this type, but many still remain inaccessible. The technique of trigonometric substitution comes in very handy when evaluating these integrals. This technique uses substitution to rewrite these integrals as trigonometric integrals. Integrals Involving a2 −x2 Before developing a general strategy for integrals containing a2 −x2, consider the integral ∫9 −x2dx. This integral cannot be evaluated using any of the techniques we have discussed so far. However, if we make the substitution x = 3sinθ, we have dx = 3cosθdθ. After substituting into the integral, we have ∫9 −x2dx = ∫ 9 −(3sinθ)23cosθdθ. After simplifying, we have ∫ 9 −x2dx = ∫9 1 −sin2 θcosθdθ. Letting 1 −sin2 θ = cos2 θ, we now have ∫ 9 −x2dx = ∫9 cos2 θcosθdθ. Assuming that cosθ ≥0, we have ∫ 9 −x2dx = ∫9cos2 θdθ. At this point, we can evaluate the integral using the techniques developed for integrating powers and products of trigonometric functions. Before completing this example, let’s take a look at the general theory behind this idea. To evaluate integrals involving a2 −x2, we make the substitution x = asinθ and dx = acosθ. To see that this actually makes sense, consider the following argument: The domain of a2 −x2 is [−a, a]. Thus, −a ≤x ≤a. Consequently, −1 ≤x a ≤1. Since the range of sinx over ⎡ ⎣−(π/2), π/2 ⎤ ⎦is [−1, 1], there is a unique angle θ satisfying −(π/2) ≤θ ≤π/2 so that sinθ = x/a, or equivalently, so that x = asinθ. If we substitute x = asinθ into a2 −x2, we get a2 −x2 = a2 −(asinθ)2 Let x = asinθ where −π 2 ≤θ ≤π 2. Simplify. = a2 −a2 sin2 θ Factor out a2. = a2(1 −sin2θ) Substitute 1 −sin2 x = cos2 x. = a2 cos2 θ Take the square root. = |acosθ| = acosθ. Since cosx ≥0 on −π 2 ≤θ ≤π 2 and a > 0, |acosθ| = acosθ. We can see, from this discussion, that by making the substitution x = asinθ, we are able to convert an integral involving a radical into an integral involving trigonometric functions. After we evaluate the integral, we can convert the solution back to an expression involving x. To see how to Chapter 3 | Techniques of Integration 287",0.0,-0.896114

One important concept based on divisibility is that of a prime number. A prime is an integer greater than 1 that is divisible by no positive integers other than 1 and itself. The study of prime numbers goes back to ancient times. Thousands of years ago it was known that there are infinitely many primes; the proof of this fact, found in the works of Euclid, is famous for its elegance and beauty. We will discuss the distribution of primes among the integers. We will describe some of the results about primes found by mathematicians in the last 400 years. In particular, we will introduce an important theorem, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. This theorem, which asserts that every positive integer can be written uniquely as the product of primes in nonde- creasing order, has many interesting consequences. We will also discuss some of the many old conjectures about primes that remain unsettled today. Primes have become essential in modern cryptographic systems, and we will develop some of their properties important in cryptography. For example, finding large primes is essential in modern cryptography. The length of time required to factor large integers into their prime factors is the basis for the strength of some important modern cryptographic systems. In this section we will also study the greatest common divisor of two integers, as well as the least common multiple of two integers. We will develop an important algorithm for computing greatest common divisors, called the Euclidean algorithm. 4.3.2 Primes Every integer greater than 1 is divisible by at least two integers, because a positive integer is divisible by 1 and by itself. Positive integers that have exactly two different positive integer factors are called primes. Definition 1 An integer p greater than 1 is called prime if the only positive factors of p are 1 and p. A positive integer that is greater than 1 and is not prime is called composite. Remark: The integer 1 is not prime, because it has only one positive factor. Note also that an integer n is composite if and only if there exists an integer a such that a ∣n and 1 < a < n.",1.0,-5.883037

What is the formula for this rule?,"In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc length as the distance you would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket is launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a road, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination. We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of x, then we examine the same process for curves defined as functions of y. (The process is identical, with the roles of x and y reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc length can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of this concept. Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x) In previous applications of integration, we required the function f(x) to be integrable, or at most continuous. However, for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for f(x). Here, we require f(x) to be differentiable, and furthermore we require its derivative, f′(x), to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.) Let f(x) be a smooth function defined over ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦. We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point ⎛ ⎝a, f(a) ⎞ ⎠ to the point ⎛ ⎝b, f(b) ⎞ ⎠. We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve. For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦. Then, for i = 1, 2,..., n, construct a line segment from the point ⎛ ⎝xi −1, f(xi −1)⎞ ⎠to the point ⎛ ⎝xi, f(xi)⎞ ⎠. Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments, we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. Figure 6.37 depicts this construct for n = 5. Figure 6.37 We can approximate the length of a curve by adding line segments. To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the change in horizontal distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over each interval is given by Δx. The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use Δyi = f(xi) −f(xi −1) to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval [xi −1, xi], as shown in Figure 6.38. Note that some (or all) Δyi may be negative. Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration 675",0.0,-3.1859822

Using the ordering of letters in the alphabet, a lexicographic ordering on the set of strings can be constructed.

This ordering is the same as that used in dictionaries. For example, discreet ≺discrete, because these strings differ first in the seventh position, and e ≺t.

For instance, consider the directed graph for the partial ordering {(a, b) ∣a ≤b} on the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, shown in Figure 2(a). Because this relation is a partial ordering, it is reflexive, and its directed graph has loops at all vertices. Consequently, we do not have to show these loops because they must be present; in Figure 2(b) loops are not shown. Because a partial ordering is transitive, we do not have to show those edges that must be present because of transitivity. For example, in Figure 2(c) the edges (1, 3), (1, 4), and (2, 4) are not shown because they must be present. If we assume that all edges are pointed “upward” (as they are drawn in the figure), we do not have to show the directions of the edges; Figure 2(c) does not show directions. In general, we can represent a finite poset (S, ≼) using this procedure: Start with the directed graph for this relation.

From Example 4.48, we see that Newton’s method does not always work. However, when it does work, the sequence of approximations approaches the root very quickly. Discussions of how quickly the sequence of approximations approach a root found using Newton’s method are included in texts on numerical analysis. Other Iterative Processes As mentioned earlier, Newton’s method is a type of iterative process. We now look at an example of a different type of iterative process. Consider a function F and an initial number x0. Define the subsequent numbers xn by the formula xn = F(xn −1). This process is an iterative process that creates a list of numbers x0, x1, x2 ,..., xn ,.... This list of numbers may approach a finite number x * as n gets larger, or it may not. In Example 4.49, we see an example of a function F and an initial guess x0 such that the resulting list of numbers approaches a finite value. Example 4.49 Finding a Limit for an Iterative Process Let F(x) = 1 2x + 4 and let x0 = 0. For all n ≥1, let xn = F(xn −1). Find the values x1, x2, x3, x4, x5.

What is the formula for ICN3?,"651 and yRz, then xRz. However, R is not reflexive, because no person is older than himself or herself. That is, x̸Rx for all people x. It follows that R is not a partial ordering. ◂ In different posets different symbols such as ≤, ⊆, and |, are used for a partial ordering. However, we need a symbol that we can use when we discuss the ordering relation in an ar- bitrary poset. Customarily, the notation a ≼b is used to denote that (a, b) ∈R in an arbitrary poset (S, R). This notation is used because the less than or equal to relation on the set of real numbers is the most familiar example of a partial ordering and the symbol ≼is similar to the ≤symbol. (Note that the symbol ≼is used to denote the relation in any poset, not just the less than or equal to relation.) The notation a ≺b denotes that a ≼b, but a ≠b. Also, we say “a is less than b” or “b is greater than a” if a ≺b. When a and b are elements of the poset (S, ≼), it is not necessary that either a ≼b or b ≼a. For instance, in (P(Z), ⊆), {1, 2} is not related to {1, 3}, and vice versa, because neither set is contained within the other. Similarly, in (Z+, ∣), 2 is not related to 3 and 3 is not related to 2, because 2 ̸ | 3 and 3 ̸ | 2. This leads to Definition 2. Definition 2 The elements a and b of a poset (S, ≼) are called comparable if either a ≼b or b ≼a.

What is the formula for S U B J E C T I N D E X?,"201 7.3 Conservation of Linear Momentum Equation 7.8 expresses the principle of conservation of linear momentum. The sum of the final momentum vectors is exactly equal to the sum of the initial momentum vectors. Note that this equation does not depend on any particular conditions for the collision. It is valid for all two-body collisions, elastic or inelastic. You may object that other external forces may be present. In a collision of billiard balls, for example, there is a friction force due to each ball rolling or sliding across the table. In a collision of two cars, friction acts between the tires and the road. However, what characterizes a collision is the occurrence of a very large impulse due to a very large contact force during a relatively short time. If you integrate the external forces over the collision time, you obtain only very small or moderate impulses. Thus, these external forces can usually be safely neglected in calculations of collision dynamics, and we can treat two-body collisions as if only internal forces are at work. We will assume we are dealing with an isolated system, which is a system with no external forces. In addition, the same argument holds if there are more than two objects taking part in the collision or if there is no collision at all. As long as the net external force is zero, the total momentum of the interaction of objects will be conserved: if = then =constant. net = F pk k n 0 1 ∑ (7.9) Equation 7.9 is the general formulation of the law of conservation of momentum. We will return to this general formulation in Chapter 8 when we talk about systems of par- ticles. For the remainder of this chapter, we consider only idealized cases in which the net external force is negligibly small, and thus the total momentum is always conserved in all processes. Derivation 7.1 During a collision, object 1 exerts a force on object 2. Let’s call this force F1 2 → . Using the defi- nition of impulse and its relationship to the momentum change, we get for the momentum change of object 2 during the collision: F dt p p p = = – . t t 1 2 2 f 2 i2 i f  ∫ → Here we neglect external forces; if they exist, they are usually negligible compared to F1 2 → during the collision. The initial and final times are selected to bracket the time of the collision process. In addition, the force F 2 1 → , which object 2 exerts on object 1, is also present. The same argument as before leads to F dt p p p = = – . t t 2 1 1 f1 i1 i f  ∫ → Newton’s Third Law (see Chapter 4) tells us that these forces are equal and opposite to each other, F F = – , 1 2 2 1 → → or F F = 0.",0.0,-6.2300873

Solution: This scheduling problem can be solved using a graph model, with vertices representing courses and with an edge between two vertices if there is a common student in the courses they represent. Each time slot for a final exam is represented by a different color. A scheduling of the exams corresponds to a coloring of the associated graph. For instance, suppose there are seven finals to be scheduled. Suppose the courses are num- bered 1 through 7. Suppose that the following pairs of courses have common students: 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 1 and 7, 2 and 3, 2 and 4, 2 and 5, 2 and 7, 3 and 4, 3 and 6, 3 and 7, 4 and 5, 4 and 6, 5 and 6, 5 and 7, and 6 and 7.

We will return to the equa- tion of motion for a mass on a spring in Chapter 14. Solved Problem 6.4 Human Cannonball In a favorite circus act, called the “human cannonball,” a person is shot from a long barrel, usu- ally with a lot of smoke and a loud bang added for theatrical effect. Before the Italian Zacchini brothers invented the compressed air cannon for shooting human cannonballs in the 1920s, the Englishman George Farini used a spring-loaded cannon for this purpose in the 1870s. Suppose someone wants to recreate Farini’s spring-loaded human cannonball act with a spring inside a barrel. Assume the barrel is 4.00 m long, with a spring that extends the entire length of the barrel. Further, the barrel is upright, so it points vertically toward the ceiling of the circus tent. The human cannonball is lowered into the barrel and compresses the spring to some degree. An external force is added to compress the spring even further, to a length of only 0.70 m. At a height of 7.50 m above the top of the barrel is a spot on the tent that the human cannonball, of height 1.75 m and mass 68.4 kg, is supposed to touch at the top of his trajectory. Removing the external force releases the spring and fires the human cannonball vertically upward. Problem 1 What is the value of the spring constant needed to accomplish this stunt? Solution 1 T H I N K Let’s apply energy conservation considerations to solve this problem. Potential energy is stored in the spring initially and then converted to gravitational potential energy at the top of the human cannonball’s flight. As a reference point for our calculations, we select the top of the barrel and place the origin of our coordinate system there. To accomplish the stunt, enough energy has to be provided, through compressing the spring, that the top of the head of the human cannonball is elevated to a height of 7.50 m above the zero point we have chosen. Since the person has a height of 1.75 m, his feet need to be elevated by only h = 7.50 m – 1.75 m = 5.75 m. We can specify all position values for the human cannonball on the y-coordinate as the position of the bottom of his feet. S K E TC H To clarify this problem, let’s apply energy conservation at different instants of time. Figure 6.13a shows the initial equilibrium position of the spring. In Figure 6.13b, the external force F and the weight of the human cannonball compress the spring by 3.30 m to a length",0.0,-3.4759052

To do this, you first need to know how the debit/ credit framework works with revenues and expenses. Let’s start with the basic accounting equation from Chapter 2: Assets equal liabilities plus stockholders’ equity, or A = L + SE. For now, focus on the stockholders’ equity category. As you already know from Chapters 1 and 2, stockholders’ equity includes (1) Common Stock, given to stockholders when they contribute capital to the company, and (2) Retained Earnings, generated by the company itself through profitable operations. Retained Earnings is the part that expands to include revenues and expenses, as shown in Exhibit 3.8. EXHIBIT 3.8 The Expanded Debit/Credit Framework Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders’ Equity Assets + Debit − Liabilities − + Credit Expenses Debit Revenues Credit Stockholders’ Equity − + Credit Common Stock − + Credit Retained Earnings − + Credit Expenses decrease Net Income and Retained Earnings, so expenses are recorded with debits, just like all decreases in stockholders’ equity. + + Revenues increase Net Income, which increases Retained Earnings, so revenues are recorded with credits, just like all increases in stockholders’ equity. Take a moment to look at how Exhibit 3.8 encourages you to think of revenues and expenses as subcategories within retained earnings. They are shown this way because revenues and expenses eventually flow into Retained Earnings, but they aren’t initially recorded there. Instead, each revenue and expense is accumulated in a separate account, making it easier to identify the amount to report for each item on the income statement. At the end of each accounting year, these separate revenue and expense accounts are transferred to (or “closed” into) Retained Earnings through a process we’ll demonstrate in Chapter 4. For now, just focus on learning how revenues and expenses are recorded to indicate increases and decreases in the company’s earnings, with corresponding effects recorded in the company’s asset and/or liability accounts. Because revenue and expense accounts are subcategories of Retained Earnings, they are affected by debits and credits in the same way as all stockholders’ equity accounts. You already know increases in stockholders’ equity are recorded on the right side. You also know revenues increase net income, which increases the stockholders’ equity account Retained Earnings. So putting these ideas together should lead to the conclusion revenues are recorded on the right (credit). Here’s the logic again: Increases in stockholders’ equity are on the right; rev enues increase stockholders’ equity, so revenues are recorded on the right (credit). Decreases in stockholders’ equity are recorded on the left side, so to show that expenses decrease net income and retained earnings, expenses are recorded on the left (debit). Exhibit 3.8 sum marizes these effects. Transaction Analysis, Recording, and Summarizing To learn how to use your new knowledge of the revenue and expense recognition principles, the expanded accounting equation, and the debit/credit framework, you’ll need lots of prac tice. Let’s continue analyzing, recording, and summarizing as we did in Chapter 2, except now we’ll focus on Noodlecake’s operating activities in September.",1.0,1.0621614

What is the formula for this rule?,"13.3 • Solubility as an Equilibrium Process 401 • Systems naturally increase their entropy (distribute their energy in more ways). A gas has higher entropy than a liquid, which has higher entropy than a solid, and a solution has higher entropy than the pure solute and solvent. • Relative sizes of the enthalpy and entropy changes determine solution formation. A substance with a positive DHsoln dissolves only if DSsoln is larger than DHsoln. 13.3 •  Solubility as an Equilibrium Process When an excess amount of solid is added to a solvent, particles leave the crystal, are surrounded by solvent, and move away. Some dissolved solute particles collide with undissolved solute and recrystallize, but, as long as the rate of dissolving is greater than the rate of recrystallizing, the concentration rises. At a given temperature, when solid is dissolving at the same rate as dissolved particles are recrystallizing, the concentra- tion remains constant and undissolved solute is in equilibrium with dissolved solute: Solute (undissolved) B A solute (dissolved) Figure 13.7 shows an ionic solid in equilibrium with dissolved cations and anions.

What is the formula for FILTER BUBBLES AND ECHO CHAMBERS?,"The ""filter bubble"" concept, coined by Eli Pariser, raises critical concerns about the impact of personalized algorithms on our access to information and the broader implications for democratic discourse. In his seminal work, Pariser warns of the dangers inherent in the way search engines and social media platforms tailor content to individual users' preferences. Thls customisation, while designed to enhance user experience by dellvermg more relevant content, inadvertently Isolates users In their informational ecosystems. Each user, according to Parlser's analysis, ends up In a 'unique universe of information' (Pariser, 2011: 10), significantly different from what others might see. Thls divergence creates a fragmented reality where shared common ground is increasingly scarce. The ramifications of living within such filter bubbles extend beyond individual information consumption. As these bubbles become more pronounced, they challenge the very fabric of sooietal dialogue and collective understanding. The tailored content reinforces existing beliefs and viewpoints, reducing exposure to divergent perspectives and, consequently, the opportunity for critical engagement and empathy with diffenng views. Thls phenomenon IS not merely theoretical but is supported by empirical research across various disciplines. Scholars such as Guess et al. (2018) and Tucker et al. (2018) have explored the extent to which personalised information environments affect social cohesion and political polarisation. Their findings suggest that as individuals become more entrenched In their filter bubbles, the likelihood of encountering and engaging with contrasting viewpoints diminishes Thls entrenchment can lead to polarised communities where mutual understanding and compromise are increasingly difficult to achieve. In essence, the concept of the filter bubble serves as a critlcaI lens through which to examine the consequences of personalised technology on public discourse and democracy. PQ 1aE Box 13.1 Exercise Quick Exploration of Personal Filter Bubbles in this digital age, the information we encounter online is often filtered through algorithms that tailor content to our perceived preferences, based on our past interactions. This personalised euration creates 'filter bubbles', environments that selectively expose us to information and viewpoints that align with our own, while inadvertently isolating us from differing perspectives. Understanding and Identifying these filter bubbles is crucial for developing a well- rounded view of the world and for fostering critical thinking skills. This exercise is designed to help you quickly recognise the fitter bubbles present in your own digital life and to reflect on their impact on your perceptions and beliefs. To identify and reflect on personal filter bubbles, you will need to take a critical look at your online consumption. This will provide an awareness of how digital interactions shape information exposure and influence your perceptions tnstrumions: Digital Snapshot Look at the first 30 items on your Instagram feed and FYP on TikTok.

Since one full rotation of 360◦cuts offan arc of length 2휋, the circumference of the unit circle, it follows that 360◦= 2휋radians, so 180◦= 휋radians. In other words, 1 radian = 180◦∕휋, so one radian is about 60◦. The word radians is often dropped, so if an angle or rotation is referred to without units, it is understood to be in radians. Radians are useful for computing the length of an arc in any circle. If the circle has radius 푟and the arc cuts offan angle 휃, as in Figure 1.64, then we have the following relation: Arc length = 푠= 푟휃. 푠 푟 휃 Figure 1.64: Arc length of a sector of a circle The Sine and Cosine Functions The two basic trigonometric functions—the sine and cosine—are defined using a unit circle.

If 푡is negative, the angle is measured clockwise around the circle. Amplitude, Period, and Phase The graphs of sine and cosine are shown in Figure 1.66. Notice that sine is an odd function, and cosine is even. The maximum and minimum values of sine and cosine are +1 and −1, because those are the maximum and minimum values of 푦and 푥on the unit circle.

Summary Increases in the price level cause a reduction in consumption, investment, and net exports. This causes the aggregate expendi- ture function to shift down on the 45°-line diagram, leading to a lower equilibrium real GDP. A decrease in the price level leads to a higher equilibrium real GDP. The aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the price level and the level of aggregate expenditure, holding constant all factors other than the price level that affect aggregate expenditure.

What is the formula for 1 Pa  1 N/m2?,"sharply debated by modern scholars. From vase paintings, we can see how the spear was used. It was either raised above the shoulder and aimed at the hoplite’s most vulnerable point, the gap between helmet and breastplate, or it was used underarm, aiming again at the vulnerable point at the bottom of the breastplate. Part of the skill of the hoplite in attack was in being able to spot what sort of spear thrust would be most effective, and to change from one approach to the other efficiently. Part of the skill of the hoplite in defence was being able to deploy the shield effectively to ward off a spear thrust, whether it came from above or below. From literary sources, it is clear that there was regularly in battles a phase of concerted shoving (@fhismos) at some stage of the battle; and there must be some point in the measured advance to battle, controlled by an aulos-player (see 7.11). Xenophon describes how Agésilaos fought the battle of Kordneia in 394 in these terms: He crashed into the Theban army head-on. As they threw shield against shield they pushed, they fought, they killed, they died. (Xenophon, /ellenika 4.3.19) Here the pushing comes immediately after the engagement, and it Is this sequence that has encouraged some scholars to see hoplite battle as pitching the weight of the massed ranks on one side against the weight of the massed ranks on the other. But at Plataia, according to Herodotos (Histories 9.67), there was a ‘fierce battle for a long time until they came to shoving’. So too, in the hand-to-hand battle outside Syracuse in 415, the two sides long resisted each other and the shoving came later (see 7.17). This possible variation in the timing of the push does not suggest that we are dealing with one interlocked line engaging with another; it looks more like a battle where each hoplite has his eye primarily on the hoplite opposite to him, and that pushing was one tactic used in the attempt to get the opponent to let down his defences.",0.0,-9.696419

Links His father became a successful architect in Paris while Eug` ene was a boy. Catalan attended a Parisian school for design hoping to follow in his father’s footsteps. At 15, he won the job of teaching geometry to his design school classmates. After graduating, Catalan attended a school for the fine arts, but because of his mathematical aptitude his instructors recommended that he enter the ́ Ecole Polytechnique. He became a student there, but after his first year, he was expelled because of his politics. However, he was readmitted, and in 1835, he graduated and won a position at the Coll` ege de Chˆ alons sur Marne. In 1838, Catalan returned to Paris where he founded a preparatory school with two other mathemati- cians, Sturm and Liouville. After teaching there for a short time, he was appointed to a position at the ́ Ecole Polytechnique. He received his doctorate from the ́ Ecole Polytechnique in 1841, but his political activity in favor of the French Republic hurt his career prospects. In 1846 Catalan held a position at the Coll` ege de Charlemagne; he was appointed to the Lyc ́ ee Saint Louis in 1849. However, when Catalan would not take a required oath of allegiance to the new Emperor Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, he lost his job. For 13 years he held no permanent position. Finally, in 1865 he was appointed to a chair of mathematics at the University of Li` ege, Belgium, a position he held until his 1884 retirement. Catalan made many contributions to number theory and to the related subject of continued fractions. He defined what are now known as the Catalan numbers when he solved the problem of dissecting a polygon into triangles using non-intersecting diagonals. Catalan is also well known for formulating what was known as the Catalan conjecture. This asserted that 8 and 9 are the only consecutive powers of integers, a conjecture not solved until 2003.",1.0,0.74715286

What is the formula for 4.8.3 Describe the relative growth rates of functions.?,"In this section, we examine a powerful tool for evaluating limits. This tool, known as L’Hôpital’s rule, uses derivatives to calculate limits. With this rule, we will be able to evaluate many limits we have not yet been able to determine. Instead of relying on numerical evidence to conjecture that a limit exists, we will be able to show definitively that a limit exists and to determine its exact value. Applying L’Hôpital’s Rule L’Hôpital’s rule can be used to evaluate limits involving the quotient of two functions. Consider lim x →a f(x) g(x). If lim x →af(x) = L1 and lim x →ag(x) = L2 ≠0, then lim x →a f(x) g(x) = L1 L2 . However, what happens if lim x →af(x) = 0 and lim x →ag(x) = 0? We call this one of the indeterminate forms, of type 0 0. This is considered an indeterminate form because we cannot determine the exact behavior of f(x) g(x) as x →a without further analysis. We have seen examples of this earlier in the text. For example, consider lim x →2 x2 −4 x −2 and lim x →0 sinx x . For the first of these examples, we can evaluate the limit by factoring the numerator and writing lim x →2 x2 −4 x −2 = lim x →2 (x + 2)(x −2) x −2 = lim x →2(x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4. For lim x →0 sinx x we were able to show, using a geometric argument, that lim x →0 sinx x = 1. Here we use a different technique for evaluating limits such as these. Not only does this technique provide an easier way to evaluate these limits, but also, and more important, it provides us with a way to evaluate many other limits that we could not calculate previously. The idea behind L’Hôpital’s rule can be explained using local linear approximations. Consider two differentiable functions f and g such that lim x →af(x) = 0 = lim x →ag(x) and such that g′(a) ≠0 For x near a, we can write f(x) ≈f(a) + f′(a)(x −a) and g(x) ≈g(a) + g′(a)(x −a). Therefore, f(x) g(x) ≈f(a) + f′(a)(x −a) g(a) + g′(a)(x −a). Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 459",1.0,-3.7676942

What is the formula for this rule?,"607 Key Points in the Article As budget shortfalls loom in many states and cities, a tax on soft drinks is being viewed as a way to not only raise revenue but also reduce consumption of a product that contributes to obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. A study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago indicates that a soda tax would affect de- mographic groups in different ways. For example, the percentage of food budgets spent on sugared beverages is lower for college graduates than for those without high school diplomas, and the caloric intake from soft drinks is highest for those living below the poverty level. So, the lowest- income families would feel the greatest im- pact from the implementation of a soda tax. Analyzing the News a In 2009, the U.S. Senate considered a proposal to place an excise tax on soda as a way to help pay for overhauling the na- tion’s health care system. Although that proposal did not pass, several states are now considering a similar tax as a way to boost revenue during a time of budget shortfalls. Between 2009 and 2010, 17 states filed legislation to implement some form of a soda tax, with Colorado and Washington passing versions of the tax. Proponents of the tax cite the health risks associated with sugared soft drinks and claim that the tax would reduce consump- tion and improve health. b A study conducted by Leslie McGranahan of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach of Northwestern University indicates that a soda tax will affect people in different ways, depending on the amount of soda purchased, where and how it is pur- chased, and the type of tax implemented. The study shows that the lowest-income families and people with less education consume the most soda and spend the highest fraction of their food budget on soda. As a consequence, these groups would feel the greatest impact of a soda tax. With a regressive tax, people with lower incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in tax than do people with higher in- comes. Because people with less education tend to earn less than those with more edu- cation, the data indicate that a soda tax would be a regressive tax. c The Center for Science in the Public In- terest claims that an 8-cent tax on a 12-ounce serving of soda would raise $11 billion per year. The figure below shows how an excise tax would affect the market for soda. The original equilibrium is at point A. The tax would shift the supply curve for soda up, from S1 to S2. The equilibrium price would increase from P1 to P2, and the equi- librium quantity would decrease from Q1 to Q2. Point B is the new equilibrium point. The actual amount by which price and quantity would change depends on the price elastic- ity of the demand and supply of soda, as we saw in this chapter. The article does not re- port on the elasticity assumptions the Cen- ter for Science in the Public Interest made in computing its value of the revenue that would be raised by the tax. We do know, though, that the tax is expected to raise $11 billion per year. If the price of a 12-ounce soda is $1, then the quantity sold each year must be $137.5 billion (because +0.08 * +137.5 billion = +11 billion). In the figure, the revenue from the tax equals the area of the green rectangle. Thinking Critically about Policy",0.0,-6.334594

This is what we mean by saying that the difference |푓(푥, 푦)−0| can be made as small as we wish by choosing the distance to be sufficiently small. Thus, we conclude that lim (푥,푦)→(0,0)푓(푥, 푦) = lim (푥,푦)→(0,0) 푥2푦 푥2 + 푦2 = 0. Notice that since this limit equals 푓(0, 0), the function 푓is continuous at (0, 0). (b) Although the formula defining the function 푔looks similar to that of 푓, we saw in Example 1 that 푔’s behavior near the origin is quite different. If we consider points (푥, 0) lying along the 푥-axis near (0, 0), then the values 푔(푥, 0) are equal to 1, while if we consider points (0, 푦) lying along the 푦-axis near (0, 0), then the values 푔(0, 푦) are equal to 0. Thus, within any distance (no matter how small) from the origin, there are points where 푔= 0 and points where 푔= 1. Therefore the limit lim(푥,푦)→(0,0) 푔(푥, 푦) does not exist, and thus 푔is not continuous at (0, 0). While the notions of limit and continuity look formally the same for one- and two-variable functions, they are somewhat more subtle in the multivariable case. The reason for this is that on the line (1-space), we can approach a point from just two directions (left or right) but in 2-space there are an infinite number of ways to approach a given point.

Second, “A” airlines are paying $1,300 per week to hire pilots who are no more produc- tive than the pilots being paid $900 per week by “B” airlines. As a result, “B” airlines will have lower costs and will be able to charge lower prices. Eventually, “A” airlines will lose their customers to “B” airlines and will be driven out of business. The market will have imposed an economic penalty on the discriminating airlines. So, discrimination will not persist, and the wages of men and women pilots will become equal. Can we conclude from this analysis that competition in markets will eliminate all economic discrimination? Unfortunately, this optimistic conclusion is not completely accurate. We know that until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed, many firms in the United States refused to hire black workers. Even though this practice had persisted for decades, nondiscriminating competitors did not drive these firms out of business. Why not? There were three important factors: 1. Worker discrimination. In some cases, white workers refused to work alongside black workers. As a result, some industries—such as the important cotton textile industry in the South—were all white. Because of discrimination by white workers, an entrepreneur who wanted to use low-cost black labor might need to hire an all- black workforce. Some entrepreneurs tried this, but because black workers had been excluded from these industries, they often lacked the skills and experience to form an effective workforce. 2. Customer discrimination. Some white consumers were unwilling to buy from companies in certain industries if they employed black workers. This was not a signifi- cant barrier in manufacturing industries, where customers would not know the race of the workers producing the good. It was, however, a problem for firms in indus- tries in which workers came into direct contact with the public. 3. Negative feedback loops. Our analysis in Figure 17.8 assumed that men and women pilots were equally qualified. However, if discrimination makes it difficult for a member of a group to find employment in a particular occupation, his or her in- centive to be trained to enter that occupation is reduced. Consider the legal profes- sion as an example. In 1952, future Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor graduated third in her class at Stanford University Law School and was an editor of Figure 17.8 Discrimination and Wages 0 Wage (dollars per week) Quantity of labor (a) Market for pilots at “A” airlines Supply1 Demand for airplane pilots $1,300 L2 L1 1,100 Supply2 1 .

What is the formula for this rule?,"164 Chapter 6 Potential Energy and Energy Conservation For conservative forces, we can immediately state two consequences of this definition: 1. If we know the work, WA→B, done by a conservative force on an object as the object moves along a path from point A to point B, then we also know the work, WB→A, that the same force does on the object as it moves along the path in the reverse direction, from point B to point A (see Figure 6.5b): W W B A A B → → = (for conservative forces). – (6.4) The proof of this statement is obtained from the condition of zero work over a closed loop. Because the path from A to B to A forms a closed loop, the sum of the work contributions from the loop has to equal zero. In other words, W W A B B A → → + =0, from which equation 6.4 follows immediately. 2. If we know the work, WA→B,path 1, done by a conservative force on an object moving along path 1 from point A to point B, then we also know the work, WA→B,path 2, done by the same force on the object when it uses any other path (path 2) to go from point A to point B (see Figure 6.5c). The work is the same; the work done by a conservative force is independent of the path taken by the object: W W A B A B → → , , path path = (for arbitrary paths 2 1 1 and 2, for conservative forces). (6.5) This statement is also easy to prove from the definition of a conservative force as a force for which the work done over any closed path is zero. The path from point A to point B on path 1 and then back from B to A on path 2 is a closed loop; therefore, WA→B,path 2 + WB→A,path 1 = 0. Now we use equation 6.4 for reversal of the path direction, WB→A,path 1 = –WA→B,path 1. Combining these two results gives us WA→B,path 2 – WA→B,path 1 = 0, from which equation 6.5 follows. One physical application of the mathematical results just given involves riding a bicycle from one point, such as your home, to another point, such as the swimming pool. Assuming that your home is located at the foot of a hill and the pool at the top, we can use the Figure 6.5c to illustrate this example, with point A representing your home and point B the pool. What the preceding statements regarding conservative forces mean is that you do the same amount of work riding your bike from home to the pool, inde- pendent of the route you select. You can take a shorter and steeper route or a flatter and longer route; you can even take a route that goes up and down between points A and B. The total work will be the same.

What is the formula for READY REFERENCE?,"3.25 We can use these bounds to determine the value of n necessary to guarantee that the error in an estimate is less than a specified value. Example 3.44 Determining the Number of Intervals to Use What value of n should be used to guarantee that an estimate of ∫ 0 1 ex2 dx is accurate to within 0.01 if we use the midpoint rule? Solution We begin by determining the value of M, the maximum value of |f′′(x)| over [0, 1] for f(x) = ex2. Since f′(x) = 2xex2, we have f ′′(x) = 2ex2 + 4x2 ex2. Thus, |f′′(x)| = 2ex2 ⎛ ⎝1 + 2x2⎞ ⎠≤2 · e · 3 = 6e. From the error-bound Equation 3.12, we have Error in Mn ≤M(b −a)3 24n2 ≤6e(1 −0)3 24n2 = 6e 24n2. Now we solve the following inequality for n: 6e 24n2 ≤0.01. Thus, n ≥ 600e 24 ≈8.24. Since n must be an integer satisfying this inequality, a choice of n = 9 would guarantee that |∫ 0 1 ex2 dx −Mn| < 0.01. Analysis We might have been tempted to round 8.24 down and choose n = 8, but this would be incorrect because we must have an integer greater than or equal to 8.24. We need to keep in mind that the error estimates provide an upper bound only for the error. The actual estimate may, in fact, be a much better approximation than is indicated by the error bound. Use Equation 3.13 to find an upper bound for the error in using M4 to estimate ∫ 0 1 x2 dx. Simpson’s Rule With the midpoint rule, we estimated areas of regions under curves by using rectangles. In a sense, we approximated the curve with piecewise constant functions. With the trapezoidal rule, we approximated the curve by using piecewise linear functions. What if we were, instead, to approximate a curve using piecewise quadratic functions? With Simpson’s rule, we do just this. We partition the interval into an even number of subintervals, each of equal width.

Equilibrium Points Three special points on the x-coordinate axis of Figure 6.20b are marked by vertical gray lines. These points indicate where the force has a value of zero. Because the force is the derivative of the potential energy with respect to the x-coordinate, the potential energy has an extre- mum—a maximum or minimum value—at such points. You can clearly see that the poten- tial energies at x1 and x3 represent minima, and the potential energy at x2 is a maximum. At all three points, an object would experience no acceleration, because it is located at an extremum where the force is zero. Because there is no force, Newton’s Second Law tells us that there is no acceleration. Thus, these points are equilibrium points. The equilibrium points in Figure 6.20 represent two different kinds. Points x1 and x3 are stable equilibrium points, and x2 is an unstable equilibrium point. What distinguishes stable and unstable equilibrium points is the response to perturbations (small changes in position around the equilibrium position). Concept Check 6.7 Which of the four drawings represents a stable equilibrium point for the ball on its supporting surface? (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 6.20 ​ (a) Potential energy as a function of position; (b) the force corresponding to this potential energy function, as a function of position. x1 (a) (b) x2 x3 U(x) x F(x) x Definition At stable equilibrium points, small perturbations result in small oscillations around the equilibrium point. At unstable equilibrium points, small perturbations result in an accelerating movement away from the equilibrium point. The roller coaster analogy may be helpful here: If you are sitting in a roller coaster car at point x1 or x3 and someone gives the car a push, it will just rock back and forth on the track, because you are sitting at a local point of lowest energy. However, if the car gets the same small push while sitting at x2, it will roll down the slope. What makes an equilibrium point stable or unstable from a mathematical standpoint is the value of the second derivative of the potential energy function, or the curvature. Negative curvature means a local maximum of the potential energy function, and therefore an unstable equilibrium point; a positive curvature indicates a stable equilibrium point. Of course, there is also the situation between a stable and unstable equilibrium, between a positive and negative curvature. This is a point of metastable equilibrium, with zero local curvature, that is, a value of zero for the second derivative of the potential energy function. Turning Points Figure 6.21a shows the same potential energy function as Figure 6.20, but with the addition of horizontal lines for four different values of the total mechanical energy (E1 through E4). For each value of this total energy and for each point on the potential energy curve, we can calculate the value of the kinetic energy by simple subtraction. Let’s first consider the largest value of the total mechanical energy shown in the figure, E1 (blue horizontal line):",0.0,-4.430601

Archons have done this with our reality, a synthetic copy of prime reality that still exists beyond the frequency walls of the simulation.

To quote Kurzweil: ‘Nanobots will infuse all the maĴer around us with information. Rocks, trees, everything will become these intelligent creatures.’ Yes, synthetic ‘creatures’ just as ‘Covid’ and other genetically-manipulating ‘vaccines’ are designed to make the human body synthetic.

The designer of the Matrix in the movies is called ‘The Architect’ and that trilogy is jam-packed with symbolism relating to these subjects. I have contended for years that the angry Old Testament God (Yaldabaoth) is the ‘God’ being symbolically ‘quoted’ in the opening of Genesis as ‘creating the world’. This is not the creation of prime reality – it’s the creation of the simulation. The Genesis ‘God’ says: ‘Let there be Light: and there was light.’ But what is this ‘Light’? I have said for decades that the speed of light (186,000 miles per second) is not the fastest speed possible as claimed by mainstream science and is in fact the frequency walls or outer limits of the Matrix. You can’t have a fastest or slowest anything within all possibility when everything is possible. The human body is encoded to operate within the speed of light or within the simulation and thus we see only the tiny frequency band of visible light.

Solution The building is given by 0 ≤푥≤8, 0 ≤푦≤16, and 0 ≤푧≤12 −푥∕4 −푦∕8. (See Figure 16.25.) To find its volume, divide it into small cubes of volume Δ푉= Δ푥Δ푦Δ푧and add. First, make a vertical stack of cubes above the point (푥, 푦, 0). This stack goes from 푧= 0 to 푧= 12 −푥∕4 −푦∕8, so Volume of vertical stack ≈ ∑ 푧 Δ푉= ∑ 푧 Δ푥Δ푦Δ푧= ( ∑ 푧 Δ푧 ) Δ푥Δ푦.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Given an algebraic formula for a function f, the graph of f is the set of points ⎛ ⎝x, f(x) ⎞ ⎠, where x is in the domain of f and f(x) is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of f consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin. When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of x where f(x) = 0 are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of f(x) = x2 −4 are x = ± 2. The zeros determine where the graph of f intersects the x -axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times. Another point of interest is the y -intercept, if it exists. The y -intercept is given by ⎛ ⎝0, f(0) ⎞ ⎠. Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one y -intercept. If x = 0 is in the domain of a function f, then f has exactly one y -intercept. If x = 0 is not in the domain of f, then f has no y -intercept. Similarly, for any real number c, if c is in the domain of f, there is exactly one output f(c), and the line x = c intersects the graph of f exactly once. On the other hand, if c is not in the domain of f, f(c) is not defined and the line x = c does not intersect the graph of f. This property is summarized in the vertical line test. Rule: Vertical Line Test Given a function f, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of f no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function. We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8). Figure 1.8 (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of a function because every vertical line intersects the set of points, at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does not represent the graph of a function because some vertical lines intersect the set of points more than once.

She contacted me during 2020 aĞer masks became compulsory in many countries to tell me how they were used as part of MKUltra programming. I had been observing ‘Covid regulations’ and the relationship between authority and public for months. I saw techniques that I knew were employed on individuals in MKUltra being used on the global population. I had read many books and manuals on mind control including one called Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars which came to light in the 1980s and was a guide on how to perceptually program on a mass scale. ‘Silent Weapons’ refers to mind-control. I remembered a line from the manual as governments, medical authorities and law enforcement agencies have so obviously talked to – or rather at – the adult population since the ‘Covid’ hoax began as if they are children. The document said: If a person is spoken to by a T.V. advertiser as if he were a twelve-year-old, then, due to suggestibility, he will, with a certain probability, respond or react to that suggestion with the uncritical response of a twelve-year-old and will reach in to his economic reservoir and deliver its energy to buy that product on impulse when he passes it in the store. That’s why authority has spoken to adults like children since all this began. Why did Michael Jackson wear masks? Every aspect of the ‘Covid’ narrative has mind-control as its central theme. Cathy O’Brien wrote an article for davidicke.com about the connection between masks and mind control. Her daughter Kelly who I first met in the 1990s was born while Cathy was still held captive in MKUltra. Kelly was forced to wear a mask as part of her programming from the age of two to dehumanise her, target her sense of individuality and reduce the amount of oxygen her brain and body received. Bingo.

State the THEOREM 2.,"The average number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm to sort n elements based on binary comparisons is Ω(n log n). 11.2.4 Prefix Codes Consider the problem of using bit strings to encode the letters of the English alphabet (where no distinction is made between lowercase and uppercase letters). We can represent each letter with a bit string of length five, because there are only 26 letters and there are 32 bit strings of length five. The total number of bits used to encode data is five times the number of characters in the text when each character is encoded with five bits. Is it possible to find a coding scheme of these letters such that, when data are coded, fewer bits are used? We can save memory and reduce transmittal time if this can be done. Consider using bit strings of different lengths to encode letters. Letters that occur more frequently should be encoded using short bit strings, and longer bit strings should be used to encode rarely occurring letters. When letters are encoded using varying numbers of bits, some method must be used to determine where the bits for each character start and end. For instance, if e were encoded with 0, a with 1, and t with 01, then the bit string 0101 could correspond to eat, tea, eaea, or tt. One way to ensure that no bit string corresponds to more than one sequence of letters is to encode letters so that the bit string for a letter never occurs as the first part of the bit string for another letter. Codes with this property are called prefix codes. For instance, the encoding of e",1.0,-5.7423058
What is the formula for this rule?,"of the most celebrated of military victories, not least because it was unex- pected, Here is Xenophon’s account: (13) The generals in Corinth, Kallias the son of Hipponikos who commanded the Athenian hoplites, and Iphikratés who commanded the peltasts, when they saw that the Spartans were few in number and unescorted by peltasts or cavalry, decided that it was safe enough to attack them with their own peltasts. If they marched along the road, they could be attacked on their unprotected side with javelins and destroyed; and if they turned in pursuit it would be easy enough for the peltasts with their light equipment to get away from hoplites. (14) Kallias drew up his hoplites close to the city and Iphikratés with his peltasts attacked the Spartan regiment. Under this assault by javelin some of the Spartans were wounded and some killed, and the shield-bearers were ordered to pick them up and carry them to Lekhaion; and they were the only men in the regiment to get away safely. The general then ordered the first ten year-groups to drive off their assailants. (15) They went after them, but failed to catch any of them. They were hoplites chasing peltasts who had a javelin throw’s start, and Iphikratés had given orders that they were ta retire before the hoplites got to grips with them, Besides, the hoplites became scattered in their efforts at pursuit, and when they turned to retire [phikratés’ men wheeled round and attacked them again. some from the front and some from the flank, running along to expose their unprotected side. In the first pursuit nine or ten of the peltasts’ javelins struck home, which encouraged them to attack still more boldly. (16) As the Spartans continued to suffer casualties. their general ordered the first fifteen year-groups to the attack and pursuit. But when they turned to retire they suffered more casualties than before. They had already lost all their best men, when the cavalry appeared and they attempted a joint pursuit. The peltasts turned to run, but the cavalry mismanaged their attack. Instead of pressing their pursuit till they had inflicted casualties they kept a continuous front with the hoplites both in advance and retreat. The Spartans continued to pursue the same tactics with the same result, becoming fewer and less resolute while their assailants became bolder and more numerous. (17) At last in desperation they formed up on a small hill, about half a mile from the sea and two miles from Lekhaion. The men of Lekhaion, when they saw them, embarked in small boats and sailed along till they were opposite the hill. The Spartans were already desperate; they were suffering acutely and being killed without being able to retaliate, and when they finally saw the hoplites coming up they broke and ran. Some plunged into the sea and a few managed to escape to Lekhaion with the cavalry: but in the whole engagement and in the subsequent flight about two hundred and fifty of them were killed. (Xenophon, Hellénika 4.5.13-17) In itself this engagement had no important influence on the course of the war. But two hundred and fifty Spartans 1n all were killed, and only three hundred and fifty survived. The disaster was the clearest demonstration that the long dominance of the hoplite could be effectively challenged.",1.0,0.28856874

What is the formula for 14.8 DIFFERENTIABILITY?,"849 Example2 Consider the function 푓(푥, 푦) = √ 푥2 + 푦2. Is 푓differentiable at the origin? Solution If we zoom in on the graph of the function 푓(푥, 푦) = √ 푥2 + 푦2 at the origin, as shown in Fig- ure 14.65, the sharp point remains; the graph never flattens out to look like a plane. Near its vertex, the graph does not look as if is well approximated (in any reasonable sense) by any plane. 푥 푦 푧 ✿ Figure 14.65: The function 푓(푥, 푦) = √ 푥2 + 푦2 is not locally linear at (0, 0): Zooming in around (0, 0) does not make the graph look like a plane Judging from the graph of 푓, we would not expect 푓to be differentiable at (0, 0). Let us check this by trying to compute the partial derivatives of 푓at (0, 0): 푓푥(0, 0) = lim h→0 푓(h, 0) −푓(0, 0) h = lim h→0 √ h2 + 0 −0 h = lim h→0 |h| h. Since |h|∕h= ±1, depending on whether happroaches 0 from the left or right, this limit does not exist and so neither does the partial derivative 푓푥(0, 0). Thus, 푓cannot be differentiable at the origin. If it were, both of the partial derivatives, 푓푥(0, 0) and 푓푦(0, 0), would exist. Alternatively, we could show directly that there is no linear approximation near (0, 0) that satis- fies the small relative error criterion for differentiability. Any plane passing through the point (0, 0, 0) has the form 퐿(푥, 푦) = 푚푥+ 푛푦for some constants 푚and 푛. If 퐸(푥, 푦) = 푓(푥, 푦) −퐿(푥, 푦), then 퐸(푥, 푦) = √ 푥2 + 푦2 −푚푥−푛푦. Then for 푓to be differentiable at the origin, we would need to show that lim h→0 푘→0 √ h2 + 푘2 −푚h−푛푘 √ h2 + 푘2 = 0. Taking 푘= 0 gives lim h→0 |h| −푚h |h| = 1 −푚lim h→0 h |h|. This limit exists only if 푚= 0 for the same reason as before. But then the value of the limit is 1 and not 0 as required. Thus, we again conclude 푓is not differentiable.",1.0,3.7775192

Thus, we have Total work done ≈ ∑ −푘푥Δ푥. In the limit, as ‖Δ푥‖ →0, this sum becomes an ordinary definite integral. Since the path starts at 푥= 20, this is the lower limit of integration; 푥= 0 is the upper limit. Thus, we get Total work done = ∫ 푥=0 푥=20 −푘푥푑푥= −푘푥2 2 | | | | 0 20 = 푘(20)2 2 = 200푘. Note that the work done is positive, since the force acts in the direction of motion. Example 3 shows how a line integral over a path parallel to the 푥-axis reduces to a one-variable integral. Section 18.2 shows how to convert any line integral into a one-variable integral. Example4 A particle with position vector ⃗ 푟is subject to a force, ⃗ 퐹, due to gravity. What is the sign of the work done by ⃗ 퐹as the particle moves along the path 퐶1, a radial line through the center of the earth, starting 8000 km from the center and ending 10,000 km from the center? (See Figure 18.8.) Solution We divide the path into small radial segments, Δ⃗ 푟, pointing away from the center of the earth and parallel to the gravitational force. The vectors ⃗ 퐹and Δ⃗ 푟point in opposite directions, so each term ⃗ 퐹⋅Δ⃗ 푟is negative. Adding all these negative quantities and taking the limit results in a negative value for the total work. Thus, the work done by gravity is negative. The negative sign indicates that we would have to do work against gravity to move the particle along the path 퐶1.

Solution Tracing a curve in the opposite direction changes the sign of the line integral because all the segments Δ⃗ 푟change direction, and so every term ⃗ 퐹⋅Δ⃗ 푟changes sign. Thus, the result will be the negative of the answer found in Example 4. Therefore, the work done by gravity as a particle moves along 퐶1 toward the center of the earth is positive.

(b) The Thrust SSC. 20 T he early studies of thermodynamics were motivated by the desire of sci- entists and engineers to discover the governing principles of engines and machines so that they could design more effi cient and powerful ones. Th e steam engine could be used to power early locomotives and ships; however, over- heated steam boilers could explode and cause damage and fatalities. Today, steam locomotives and ships are used primarily on scenic routes for tourists. Th e principles that aff ect the effi ciency of heat engines apply to all engines, from steam locomotives (Figure 20.1a) to jet engines. Th e Th rust SSC (super- sonic car) shown in Figure 20.1b, used two powerful jet engines to set a land speed record of 763 mph in October 1997. However, for all its speed and power, it still produces more waste heat than usable energy, which is true of most engines. In this chapter, we examine heat engines in theory and in practice. Th eir operation is governed by the Second Law of Th ermodynamics—one of the most far-reaching and powerful statements in all of science. Th ere are several diff erent ways to express this law, including one involving a concept called entropy. Th e ideas discussed in this chapter have applications to practically all areas of science, including information processing, biology, and astronomy. the Second law of thermodynamics (a) (b) bau13881_ch20.indd 617 8/20/12 4:01 PM",0.0,-6.56771

For measles ‘virus’ see all ‘viruses’ including the so-called ‘Covid virus’. Enders, the ‘Father of Modern Vaccines’, also said: There is a potential risk in employing cultures of primate cells for the production of vaccines composed of attenuated virus, since the presence of other agents possibly latent in primate tissues cannot be definitely excluded by any known method. Cowan further quotes from a paper published in the journal Viruses in May, 2020, while the ‘Covid pandemic’ was well underway in the media if not in reality. ‘EVs’ here refers to particles of genetic debris from our own tissues, such as exosomes of which more in a moment: ‘The remarkable resemblance between EVs and viruses has caused quite a few problems in the studies focused on the analysis of EVs released during viral infections.’ Later the paper adds that to date a reliable method that can actually guarantee a complete separation (of EVs from viruses) DOES NOT EXIST. This was published at a time when a fairy tale ‘virus’ was claimed in total certainty to be causing a fairy tale ‘viral disease’ called ‘Covid-19’ – a fairy tale that was already well on the way to transforming human society in the image that the Cult has worked to achieve for so long. Cowan concludes his article: To summarize, there is no scientific evidence that pathogenic viruses exist. What we think of as ‘viruses’ are simply the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues and cells. When we are well, we make fewer of these particles; when we are starved, poisoned, suffocated by wearing masks, or afraid, we make more. There is no engineered virus circulating and making people sick. People in laboratories all over the world are making genetically modified products to make people sick. These are called vaccines. There is no virome, no ‘ecosystem’ of viruses, viruses are not 8%, 50% or 100 % of our genetic material. These are all simply erroneous ideas based on the misconception called a virus.

What is the formula for 2.2 THE DERIVATIVE AT A POINT?,"140 Chapter 5 Kinetic Energy, Work, and Power Because mg F = g and   r r = , we can write the work done on the vase as W F r = cos . From the two limiting cases we have just discussed, we gain confidence that we can use the equation we have just derived for motion on an inclined plane as the definition of the work done by a constant force: W F r F = where is the angle between cos , and r. This equation for the work done by a constant force acting over some spatial displacement holds for all constant force vectors, arbitrary displacement vectors, and angles between the two. Figure 5.9 shows three cases for the work done by a force F acting over a displacement r. In Figure 5.9a, the maximum work is done because  = 0 and F and r are in the same direction. In Figure 5.9b, F is at an arbitrary angle  with respect to r. In Figure 5.9c, no work is done because F is perpendicular to r. Using a scalar product (see Section 1.6), we can write the work done by a constant force as W F r = .  i  (5.5) This equation is the main result of this section. It says that the work done by a constant force F in displacing an object by  r is the scalar product of the two vectors. In particu- lar, if the displacement is perpendicular to the force, the scalar product is zero, and no work is done. Note that we can use any force vector and any displacement vector in equation 5.5. If there is more than one force acting on an object, the equation holds for any of the individual forces, and it holds for the net force. The mathematical reason for this generalization lies in the distributive property of the scalar product. To verify this statement, we can look at a constant net force that is the sum of individual constant forces, F F = . i i net ∑ According to equation 5.5, the work done by this net force is    i i i W F r F r F r W = = = = . i i i i i i net net ∑ ∑ ∑ ( )                In other words, the net work done by the net force is equal to the sum of the work done by the individual forces. We have demonstrated this additive property of work only for constant forces, but it is also valid for variable forces (or, strictly speaking, only for conser- vative forces, which we’ll encounter in Chapter 6). But to repeat the main point: Equation 5.5 is valid for each individual force as well as the net force. We will typically consider the net force when calculating the work done on an object, but we will omit the index “net” to simplify the notation.",0.0,-5.401498

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 3?,"a) How many cards must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least three cards of the same suit are selected? A standard deck of 52 cards has 13 kinds of cards, with four cards of each of kind, one in each of the four suits, hearts, diamonds, spades, and clubs. b) How many must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least three hearts are selected? Solution: a) Suppose there are four boxes, one for each suit, and as cards are selected they are placed in the box reserved for cards of that suit. Using the generalized pigeonhole principle, we see that if N cards are selected, there is at least one box containing at least ⌈N∕4⌉cards. Consequently, we know that at least three cards of one suit are selected if ⌈N∕4⌉≥3. The smallest integer N such that ⌈N∕4⌉≥3 is N = 2 ⋅4 + 1 = 9, so nine cards suffice. Note that if eight cards are selected, it is possible to have two cards of each suit, so more than eight cards are needed. Consequently, nine cards must be selected to guarantee that at least three cards of one suit are chosen. One good way to think about this is to note that after the eighth card is chosen, there is no way to avoid having a third card of some suit. b) We do not use the generalized pigeonhole principle to answer this question, because we want to make sure that there are three hearts, not just three cards of one suit. Note that in the worst case, we can select all the clubs, diamonds, and spades, 39 cards in all, before we select a single heart. The next three cards will be all hearts, so we may need to select 42 cards to get three hearts. ◂",0.0,-4.561439

In applications, the function being optimized often contains a parameter whose value depends on the situation, and the maximum or minimum depends on the parameter. Example4 (a) For a positive constant 푏, the surge function 푓(푡) = 푡푒−푏푡gives the quantity of a drug in the body for time 푡≥0. Find the global maximum and minimum of 푓(푡) for 푡≥0. (b) Find the value of 푏making 푡= 10 the global maximum. Solution (a) Differentiating and factoring gives 푓′(푡) = 1 ⋅푒−푏푡−푏푡푒−푏푡= (1 −푏푡)푒−푏푡, so there is a critical point at 푡= 1∕푏. The sign of 푓′ is determined by the sign of (1 −푏푡), so 푓′ is positive to the left of 푡= 1∕푏 and negative to the right of 푡= 1∕푏. Since 푓increases to the left of 푡= 1∕푏and decreases to the right of 푡= 1∕푏, the global maximum occurs at 푡= 1∕푏.",1.0,-0.0004197203

Its pro- ducer surplus on the second cup is $0.50 (rectangle B). Its producer surplus on the third cup is $0.25 (rectangle C). Heavenly will not be willing to supply the fourth cup because the marginal cost of producing it is greater than the market price. Heavenly Tea’s total producer surplus is equal to $0.75 1 $0.50 1 $0.25 5 $1.50 (or the sum of rectangles A, B, and C). A higher price will increase producer surplus. For example, if the market price of chai tea rises from $2.00 to $2.25, Heavenly Tea’s producer surplus will increase from $1.50 to $2.25. (Make sure you understand how the new level of producer surplus was calculated.) The supply curve shown in panel (a) of Figure 4.4 does not look like the smooth curves we saw in Chapter 3 because this example uses a single firm producing only a small quantity of tea. With many firms, the market supply curve for chai tea will have the normal smooth shape shown in panel (b) of Figure 4.4. In panel (b), the quantity supplied at a price of $2.00 is 15,000 cups per day. We can calculate total producer sur- plus in panel (b) the same way we did in panel (a): by adding up the producer surplus received on each cup sold. Therefore, the total amount of producer surplus in a market is equal to the area above the market supply curve and below the market price. The total producer surplus tea sellers receive from selling chai tea is shown as the red area in panel (b) of Figure 4.4. What Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus Measure We have seen that consumer surplus measures the benefit to consumers from participating in a market, and producer surplus measures the benefit to producers from participating in a market. It is important, however, to be clear about what this means. In a sense, consumer surplus measures the net benefit to consumers from participating in a market rather than the total benefit. That is, if the price of a product were zero, the consumer surplus in a market would be all of the area under the demand curve. When the price is not zero, consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above Price (dollars per cup) Quantity (cups per week) Market price 2.00 B Producer surplus on the second cup C Producer surplus on the third cup A Producer surplus on the first cup 1.50 1.75 0 1.25 Heavenly Tea’s supply curve $2.25 (a) Producer surplus for Heavenly Tea 1 2 3 4 0 Price (dollars per cup) Quantity (cups per week) 15,000 $2.00 Supply",0.0,-3.5700107

What is the formula for KEY EXCHANGE?,"- duce a focused image on the digital sensor. Thus, the photographer can increase the depth of field of an image by closing down the aperture and increasing the exposure time, or decrease the depth of field by opening the aperture and decreasing the exposure time. The standard photographic film used for many years was 36 mm wide and 24 mm tall and was usually called 35-mm film. Most digital sensors are much smaller than 35-mm film. A typical small digital camera has a digital sensor that is 5.76 mm wide and 4.29 mm tall. This small size affects the magnification of the image produced by the camera, depending on the focal length of the lens. The angle of view of the camera, , is more relevant to photography than the magnification. The angle of view can be defined in terms of the horizontal angle, the vertical angle, or the diagonal angle, where horizontal and vertical refer to the geometry of the film or digital sensor. We will consider the horizontal angle of view here, but the other two versions can be easily calculated from our results for the horizontal angle of view. We can derive an expression for the horizontal angle of view, , starting with our defi- nition of linear magnification, m, m h h d d = =– , i o i o where hi is the image height, ho is the object height, di is the image distance, and do is the object distance. Because photogra- phers are not concerned about whether the image is upright or inverted, we will use the absolute value of the heights and dis- tances in this calculation. In Figure 33.31 we show a schematic drawing containing an object, its corresponding image on film or a digital sensor, and the lens.

What is the formula for 13 Slope: 2?,"989 32.4 Refraction and Snell’s Law Example 32.3 ​ Apparent Depth You are standing on the edge of a pond and looking at the water at an angle of 2 = 45.0° to the vertical, as shown in Figure 32.40. You see a fish in the pond. The actual depth of the fish is dactual = 1.50 m. Problem What is the apparent depth of the fish from your vantage point? Solution Light rays from the fish are refracted at the surface of the water into your eyes at a 45.0° angle as shown in Figure 32.40. In the figure we show a central ray as representative of a collection of rays emit- ted from one point on the body of the fish (semitransparent cone). Where the eyes see these rays intersect is where you locate the fish. The apparent depth of the fish is located along the upper dashed horizontal line in Figure 32.40, extrapolated from the direction of the light rays as they enter your eye. This extrapolated line makes an angle 2 = 45.0° with the normal to the surface of the water. for light to be incident on various media from air, so we can write the formula for refrac- tion of light incident on a surface of a medium with index of refraction nmedium as nmedium air medium = sin sin ,   (32.12) where air is the angle of incidence (relative to the surface normal) for light in air and medium is the angle of the refracted light (relative to the surface normal) in the medium. Note that air is always greater than medium! Also note that for light coming out of a medium into air, the refraction formula is the same (equation 32.12)! This is a special case of the general statement advanced ear- lier: All ray-tracing figures remain valid if the direction of the light rays is reversed. For example, changing the direction of the arrows on the red line in Figure 32.38 still yields a physically valid path for a light ray crossing the boundary between the two media. Fermat’s Principle We have just stated that Snell’s Law cannot be proven using ray optics alone. But there is a qualifier to this statement: If you accept Fermat’s Principle, then Snell’s Law emerges automatically. Fermat’s Principle, or the principle of least time, as expressed by Fer- mat in 1657, states that the path taken by a ray of light between two points in space is the path that takes the least time. How can we prove Snell’s Law this way? The key is the connection between the speed of light in a medium, v, and the medium’s index of refraction, n, which was established in equation 32.10. If light moves at different speeds in two media, then Fermat’s Principle is analogous to the logic used in determining who won the aquathlon race, which we did in Example 2.6 and the following text. In that problem, we calculated the angle at which a con- testant must swim to shore in a race that consists of a swim to shore (with one given speed) and a run along the shore (with another speed). Winning the race means taking the minimum time, which is exactly what Fermat’s Principle postulates.",0.0,-5.3576975

What is the formula for this rule?,"the extraordinary work of the preceding centuries, In mathematics, rhetoric, history, ethics, politics, linguistics, logic, and then in the more scientific disci- plines (medicine, biology and physics), thinkers of the stature of Protagoras, Hippokratés, Sokratés, Plato and Aristotle constructed systematic disciplines which have been the basis of Western understanding for most of the two and a half millennia since their time. In the arts, the tragedians, sculptors and architects created works of such excellence that they continue to shape what drama, statues and buildings look like in the Western world today. What fuelled this intense creativity is far from clear. Many of the crucial develop- ments were made by men born and active in cities other than Athens, and we often know little of their social and political background. Many of those men visited or spent time in Athens, But while we can be reasonably confident of the importance of the particular Athenian situation on a long-term resident such as Aristotle, born in the north Aegean town of Stageira, it is less clear that Protagoras from Abdéra, for example. gained a great deal from his brief visit to Athens, closely related though Pr6tagoras’ ideas are to the theory of democracy (8.29). Some cultural and intellectual developments, however, such as tragedy and comedy, Socratic philosophy, and forensic rhetoric, seem more closely related to specifically Athenian institutions, while it is hard to divorce developments in sculpture from the unprecedented investment tn architectural sculpture which Athenian imperial wealth made possible (8.91, 95).

What is the formula for this rule?,"105 4.5 Ropes and Pulleys This formula, F = ma, is arguably the second-most famous equation in all of physics. (We will encounter the most famous, E =mc2, later in the book.) Equation 4.7 tells us that the magnitude of the acceleration of an object is proportional to the magnitude of the net exter- nal force acting on it. It also tells us that for a given external force, the magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of the object. All things being equal, more massive objects are harder to accelerate than less massive ones. However, equation 4.7 tells us even more, because it is a vector equation. It says that the acceleration vector experienced by the object with mass m is in the same direction as the net external force vector that is acting on the object to cause this acceleration. Because it is a vector equation, we can immediately write the equations for the three spatial components: F ma F ma F ma x x y y z z net, net, net, = = = , , . This result means that F = ma holds independently for each Cartesian component of the force and acceleration vectors. Newton’s Third Law If you have ever ridden a skateboard, you must have made the following observation: If you are standing at rest on the skateboard, and you step off over the front or back, the skate- board shoots off into the opposite direction. In the process of stepping off, the skateboard exerts a force on your foot, and your foot exerts a force onto the skateboard. This experience seems to suggest that these forces point in opposite directions, and it provides one example of a general truth, quantified in Newton’s Third Law. Newton’s Third Law: The forces that two interacting objects exert on each other are always exactly equal in magnitude and opposite in direction: F F = – . 1 2 2 1 → → (4.8) Note that these two forces do not act on the same body but are the forces with which two bodies act on each other. Newton’s Third Law seems to present a paradox. For example, if a horse pulls forward on a wagon with the same force with which the wagon pulls backward on the horse, then how do horse and wagon move anywhere? The answer is that these forces act on different objects in the system. The wagon experiences the pull from the horse and moves forward. The horse feels the pull from the wagon and pushes hard enough against the ground to overcome this force and move forward. A free-body diagram of an object can show only half of such an action-reaction pair of forces. Newton’s Third Law is a consequence of the requirement that internal forces—that is, forces that act between different components of the same system—must add to zero; otherwise, their sum would contribute to a net external force and cause an acceleration, according to Newton’s Second Law. No object or group of objects can accelerate itself or themselves without interacting with external objects. The story of Baron Münchhausen, who claimed to have pulled himself out of a swamp by simply pulling very hard on his own hair, is unmasked by Newton’s Third Law as complete fiction. We’ll consider some examples of the use of Newton’s laws to solve problems, after we discuss how ropes and pulleys convey forces. Many problems involving Newton’s laws involve forces on a rope (or a string), often one wrapped around a pulley.",0.0,-0.7136177

What is the formula for 1.5 Mass (kg) of solution?,"1221 39.1 Reductionism Greek philosopher Democritus was the earliest prominent proponent of the atomis- tic theory of matter. The four elements of the Greek atomistic theory were earth, air, fire, and water, which were arranged in a two-by-two matrix of hot-cold and wet- dry opposites (see Figure 39.3), and which were thought to be immutable. Aristotle added to these four a fifth element, quintessence, which he thought to be the material of which the heavens were made. The Greek atomistic theory was forgotten until the Renaissance. Then phi- losophers, physicists, and chemists created a new atomistic view of the world, and it proved to be incredibly successful and productive. By 1869, many differ- ent kinds of atoms had been identified as the elementary building blocks of the chemical elements. The Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev (1834–1907) took a giant step forward in that year by arranging the atoms of the elements in the periodic table. The current count of the different known elements is 118: the 112 elements from hydrogen through copernicium, plus the yet unnamed elements 113 through 118. The idea of simplicity is intimately connected with reductionism. According to the rule known as Occam’s razor, when an observation can be explained by several alternative theories, the simplest explanation is usually preferable. In addition, physical theories are often guided by the search for symmetry and abstract beauty, as well as the more practi- cal demands of consistency and reproducibility. While physics is the basic science and is usually concerned with measurable facts, at the level discussed here it is also influenced by concepts from philosophy and even the arts. The fact that so many kinds of atoms exist led many people to speculate at the end of the 19th century that atoms are not really the most basic fundamental building blocks of matter and that there must be an underlying, more fundamental structure. This more fun- damental structure turned out to be a hierarchy of several layers. The rest of this chapter is devoted to peeling back these layers one at a time. Nuclear physics and elementary particle physics are devoted to searching for this fundamental structure explaining the phenomena observed at the respective size scales. The reductionist quest to discover the most fundamental level is far from complete. For example, nuclear and particle physicists are currently engaged in this quest using the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, Figure 39.4) at CERN (straddling the Swiss-French border, near Geneva), which became operational in 2008. Cathedral-size caves located approximately 100 m underground house the largest par- ticle detectors ever built.

What is the formula for S-40?,"20.4 •  Free Energy, Equilibrium, and Reaction Direction As you know from discussions in earlier chapters, the sign of DG is not the only way to predict reaction direction. In Chapter 17, we did so by comparing the values of the reaction quotient (Q) and the equilibrium constant (K). Recall that • If Q , K (Q/K , 1): reaction proceeds spontaneously to the right. • If Q . K (Q/K . 1): reaction proceeds spontaneously to the left. • If Q 5 K (Q/K 5 1): reaction has attained equilibrium and no longer proceeds spontaneously in either direction. It is easier to see the relation between these two ways to predict reaction spontaneity— the sign of DG and the magnitude of Q/K—when we compare the sign of the natural logarithm of Q/K (ln Q/K) with the sign of DG (refer to Appendix A if necessary) : • If Q/K , 1, then ln Q/K , 0: reaction proceeds spontaneously to the right (DG , 0). • If Q/K . 1, then ln Q/K . 0: reaction proceeds spontaneously to the left (DG . 0). • If Q/K 5 1, then ln Q/K 5 0: reaction is at equilibrium (DG 5 0). Note that the signs of DG and of ln Q/K are the same for a given direction; in fact, DG equals ln Q/K multiplied by the proportionality constant RT: DG 5 RT ln Q K 5 RT ln Q 2 RT ln K (20.11) Q represents the concentrations (or pressures) of a system’s components at any time during the reaction, and K represents these quantities at equilibrium. Therefore, Equa- tion 20.11 says that DG is a measure of how different the ratio of concentrations, Q, is from their ratio at equilibrium, K: • If Q and K are very different, the reaction releases (or absorbs) a lot of free energy. • If Q and K are nearly the same, the reaction releases (or absorbs) relatively little.

If an?,"By now you have progressed from the very informal definition of a limit in the introduction of this chapter to the intuitive understanding of a limit. At this point, you should have a very strong intuitive sense of what the limit of a function means and how you can find it. In this section, we convert this intuitive idea of a limit into a formal definition using precise mathematical language. The formal definition of a limit is quite possibly one of the most challenging definitions you will encounter early in your study of calculus; however, it is well worth any effort you make to reconcile it with your intuitive notion of a limit. Understanding this definition is the key that opens the door to a better understanding of calculus. Quantifying Closeness Before stating the formal definition of a limit, we must introduce a few preliminary ideas. Recall that the distance between two points a and b on a number line is given by |a −b|. • The statement |f(x) −L| < ε may be interpreted as: The distance between f(x) and L is less than ε. • The statement 0 < |x −a| < δ may be interpreted as: x ≠a and the distance between x and a is less than δ. It is also important to look at the following equivalences for absolute value: • The statement |f(x) −L| < ε is equivalent to the statement L −ε < f(x) < L + ε. • The statement 0 < |x −a| < δ is equivalent to the statement a −δ < x < a + δ and x ≠a. With these clarifications, we can state the formal epsilon-delta definition of the limit. Definition Let f(x) be defined for all x ≠a over an open interval containing a. Let L be a real number. Then lim x →af(x) = L if, for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0, such that if 0 < |x −a| < δ, then |f(x) −L| < ε. This definition may seem rather complex from a mathematical point of view, but it becomes easier to understand if we break it down phrase by phrase. The statement itself involves something called a universal quantifier (for every ε > 0), an existential quantifier (there exists a δ > 0), and, last, a conditional statement (if 0 < |x −a| < δ, then |f(x) −L| < ε). Let’s take a look at Table 2.9, which breaks down the definition and translates each part. 196 Chapter 2 | Limits This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",0.0,-8.079484

State the 2.6.4 Apply the theorem of Pappus for volume..,"In this section, we consider centers of mass (also called centroids, under certain conditions) and moments. The basic idea of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the ends of sticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a single plate (without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the stick anywhere other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers spin the plates; the spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.) Mathematically, that sweet spot is called the center of mass of the plate. In this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider centers of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use centroids to find the volume of certain solids by applying the theorem of Pappus. Center of Mass and Moments Let’s begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 2.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses m1 and m2 at distances d1 and d2 from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.62(b). Figure 2.62 (a) A thin rod rests on a fulcrum. (b) Masses are placed on the rod. The most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with children of different weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier child sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the seesaw balances. Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and only if m1 d1 = m2 d2. In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However, we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses, m1 and m2, located on a number line at points x1 and x2, respectively (Figure 2.63). The center of mass, x – , is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system balance. Chapter 2 | Applications of Integration 203",1.0,3.3098655

What is the formula for this rule?,"61 Key Points in the Article This article discusses General Motors’s plan to produce an electric car for its Cadillac brand with an upgrade of the powertrain technology currently in use in its Chevy Volt plug-in car. GM introduced a concept ver- sion of this Cadillac model in 2009, and after positive reviews, it was approved for production, only to be shelved two months later amid concerns about profitability and performance. High demand for the Volt and improvements to the Voltec power- train alleviated the profitability and perfor- mance concerns, and GM again approved production of the Cadillac model, with a planned introduction in 2013. GM views production of an electric plug-in vehicle as essential for Cadillac in its effort to compete with other luxury automobile brands that have plug-in vehicles in the planning stages. Analyzing the News a Based on positive reaction to the Cadil- lac Converj concept vehicle in 2009, GM officials approved the car for produc- tion, but concerns, including its initial limited production estimates, caused GM to re- verse course and cancel its plans. Subse- quently, high demand for the Volt led GM to increase production of the Voltec power- train. This increased production of power- trains caused GM to increase its initial production estimates of the Cadillac at a potentially lower per-unit cost, again making the production version viable. If we assume that in 2009 the resources available to GM to produce its Voltec powertrain were fixed, and 10,000 could be produced, then GM must decide how to allocate those resources between producing powertrains for its Chevy and for its Cadillac. In the fig- ure below, we illustrate the trade-off GM faces with a production possibilities frontier. In 2009, we will assume that GM was at point A, devoting 8,000 powertrains for its already-approved Volt and only 2,000 for its newly approved Converj. At point A, GM decided that the small quantity of power- trains that could be devoted to the Converj was insufficient to meet profitability goals and that the production would be better de- voted entirely to the Volt, thereby moving production from point A to point B. b When announcing that the Converj would become a production car in 2013, GM had determined that its increased pro- duction of the Voltec powertrain and the pos- sibility of charging a higher selling price for Voltec vehicles could increase the profit po- tential for these vehicles. By 2013, when it expects to start selling the Converj, GM will have allocated additional resources and em- ployed improved technology to the produc- tion of the Voltec powertrain, allowing the company to increase its production num- bers. Assume that in 2013 GM is capable of producing 30,000 Voltec powertrains. This is represented in the figure below by the pro- duction possibilities frontier shifting out, al- lowing GM to devote more powertrains to both the Volt and the Converj. In the figure, we assume that GM will move to point C and will allocate 22,000 powertrains to produc- tion of the Volt and 8,000 to the Converj. c GM still has reservations about approving additional electric models for its Cadillac brand, citing performance con- cerns for these heavier vehicles. For GM to choose to devote additional resources to address these concerns, it would need to allocate fewer resources to its current production. Companies can weigh the opportunity costs of devoting their limited resources to their various production alter- natives to help determine the allocation of resources.

State the COROLLARY 2.,"Figure 12.22 The crystal lattice and the unit cell. A, A small portion of a lattice is shown as points connected by lines, with a unit cell (colored ). B, A checkerboard analogy for a lattice. The Crystal Lattice and the Unit Cell ​ The particles in a crystal are packed tightly in an orderly, three-dimensional array. As the simplest case, consider the particles as identical spherical atoms, and imagine a point at the center of each. The collection of points forms a regular pattern called the crystal lattice. The lattice consists of all points with identical surroundings; that is, there would be no way to tell if you moved from one lattice point to another. Figure 12.22A shows a portion of a lattice and the unit cell, the smallest portion that gives the crystal if it is repeated in all directions. A two-dimensional analogy for a unit cell and the resulting crystal lattice appears in a checkerboard (Figure 12.22B), a section of tiled floor, a strip of wallpaper, or any other pattern that is constructed from a repeating unit. There are 7 crystal systems and 14 types of unit cells that occur in nature, but we will be concerned primarily with the cubic system. The solid states of a majority of metallic elements, some covalent compounds, and many ionic compounds occur as cubic lattices. A key parameter of any lattice is the coordination number, the number of nearest neighbors of a particle. There are three types of cubic unit cells: 1. In the simple cubic unit cell (Figure 12.23A), the centers of eight identical particles define the corners of a cube (shown in the expanded view, top row). The particles touch along the cube edges (see the space-filling view, second row), but they do not touch diagonally along the cube faces or through its center. An expanded portion of the crystal (third row) shows that the coordination number of each particle is 6: four in its own layer, one in the layer above, and one in the layer below. 2. In the body-centered cubic unit cell (Figure 12.23B), identical particles lie at each corner and in the center of the cube. Those at the corners do not touch each other, but they all touch the one in the center. Each particle is surrounded by eight nearest neighbors, four above and four below, so the coordination number is 8. 3. In the face-centered cubic unit cell (Figure 12.23C), identical particles lie at each corner and in the center of each face but not in the center of the cube. Particles at the corners touch those in the faces but not each other. The coordination number is 12. How many particles make up a unit cell? For particles of the same size, the higher the coordination number is, the greater the number of particles in a given volume. Since one unit cell touches another, with no gaps, a particle at a corner or face is shared by adjacent cells. In the cubic unit cells, the particle at each corner is part of eight adjacent cells (Figure 12.23, third row), so one-eighth of each particle belongs to each cell (bottom row). There are eight corners in a cube, so",0.0,-6.060092

Although the values of both functions become arbitrarily large as the values of x become sufficiently large, sometimes one function is growing more quickly than the other.

On the other hand, for f(x) = x2 and g(x) = 3x2 + 4x + 1, although the values of g(x) are always greater than the values of f(x) for x > 0, each value of g(x) is roughly three times the corresponding value of f(x) as x →∞, as shown in the following table.

In 1916 he returned to Harvard as a faculty member in the philosophy department. He remained at Harvard until his retirement in 1952. Sheffer introduced what is now known as the Sheffer stroke in 1913; it became well known only after its use in the 1925 edition of Whitehead and Russell’s Principia Mathematica. In this same edition Russell wrote that Sheffer had invented a powerful method that could be used to simplify the Principia. Because of this comment, Sheffer was something of a mystery man to logicians, especially because Sheffer, who published little in his career, never published the details of this method, only describing it in mimeographed notes and in a brief published abstract. Sheffer was a dedicated teacher of mathematical logic. He liked his classes to be small and did not like auditors. When strangers appeared in his classroom, Sheffer would order them to leave, even his colleagues or distinguished guests visiting Harvard. Sheffer was barely five feet tall; he was noted for his wit and vigor, as well as for his nervousness and irritability. Although widely liked, he was quite lonely. He is noted for a quip he spoke at his retirement: “Old professors never die, they just become emeriti.” Sheffer is also credited with coining the term “Boolean algebra” (the subject of Chapter 12 of this text). Sheffer was briefly married and lived most of his later life in small rooms at a hotel packed with his logic books and vast files of slips of paper he used to jot down his ideas.

Brutality against public protestors soon became commonplace even on girls, women and old people as the brave men with the batons – the Face-Nappies as I call them – broke up peaceful protests and handed out fines like confeĴi to people who couldn’t earn a living let alone pay hundreds of pounds for what was once an accepted human right. Robot Face-Nappies of NoĴingham police in the English East Midlands fined one group £11,000 for aĴending a child’s birthday party. For decades I charted the transformation of law enforcement as genuine, decent officers were replaced with psychopaths and the brain dead who would happily and brutally do whatever their masters told them. Now they were let loose on the public and I would emphasise the point that none of this just happened. The step-by-step change in the dynamic between police and public was orchestrated from the shadows by",0.0,-9.125772
State the THEOREM 1.,"Let R be a relation on a set A. There is a path of length n, where n is a positive integer, from a to b if and only if (a, b) ∈Rn. Proof: We will use mathematical induction. By definition, there is a path from a to b of length one if and only if (a, b) ∈R, so the theorem is true when n = 1. Assume that the theorem is true for the positive integer n. This is the inductive hypothesis. There is a path of length n + 1 from a to b if and only if there is an element c ∈A such that there is a path of length one from a to c, so (a, c) ∈R, and a path of length n from c to b, that is, (c, b) ∈Rn. Consequently, by the inductive hypothesis, there is a path of length n + 1 from a to b if and only if there is an element c with (a, c) ∈R and (c, b) ∈Rn. But there is such an element if and only if (a, b) ∈Rn+1. Therefore, there is a path of length n + 1 from a to b if and only if (a, b) ∈Rn+1. This completes the proof. 9.4.4 Transitive Closures We now show that finding the transitive closure of a relation is equivalent to determining which pairs of vertices in the associated directed graph are connected by a path. With this in mind, we define a new relation.",1.0,4.2111917
What is the formula for this rule?,"742 10 / Graphs A knight is a chess piece that can move either two spaces hor- izontally and one space vertically or one space horizontally and two spaces vertically. That is, a knight on square (x, y) can move to any of the eight squares (x ± 2, y ± 1), (x ± 1, y ± 2), if these squares are on the chessboard, as illustrated here. A knight’s tour is a sequence of legal moves by a knight start- ing at some square and visiting each square exactly once. A knight’s tour is called reentrant if there is a legal move that takes the knight from the last square of the tour back to where the tour began. We can model knight’s tours using the graph that has a vertex for each square on the board, with an edge connecting two vertices if a knight can legally move between the squares represented by these vertices. 56. Draw the graph that represents the legal moves of a knight on a 3 × 3 chessboard. 57.

What is the formula for 18.29 Give the formula of the conjugate base:?,"aggregate expenditure will never equal national income, and the basic macroeconomic story is incorrect. Answer: As discussed in Chapter 8, national income equals GDP (disregarding depreciation, as we have throughout this chapter). So, it is correct to say that in macroeconomic equi- librium, planned aggregate expenditure must equal national income. But the last sentence of the argument is incorrect because it assumes that aggregate expenditure is the same as consumption spending. Because of saving and taxes, consumption spending is always much less than national income, but in equilibrium, the sum of consumption spend- ing, planned investment spending, government purchases, and net exports does, in fact, equal GDP and national in- come. So, the argument is incorrect because it confuses consumption spending with aggregate expenditure.

What is the formula for this rule?,"171 first search. A more complete description of beam search was given in [13]. Beam search has been successfully applied to learning [27], jobshop schedul- ing [31], speech recognition [87], planning [104], vision [126], and other applications. In essence, forward pruning is a nonsystematic search strategy, as it explores some selected search avenues of a search space and may miss a goal node completely. Forward pruning is similar to iterative sampling of [83], with the main difference being that forward pruning uses heuristic rules to decide if a node should be expanded, while iterative sampling makes that choice randomly. Complete forward pruning is a combination of forward pruning heuristics and iterative weakening [120]. Iterative weakening directly follows iterative deepening [74] and iterative broadening [37]. These iterative methods all repeatedly apply a search process, but with stronger or weaker parameters in different passes. It has been shown that a given set of search policies should be applied in increasing order of the search complexities that these policies incur [120]. Complete forward pruning bears a close similarity to iterative broad- ening [37]. Briefly, iterative broadening first carries out a search with a breadth limit of two, and if it fails, the algorithm repeats the search with breadth limit of three, and so on, until it finds a solution. Early passes of both algorithms comb through the state space for better solutions, and they gradually extend the coverage of their exploration by increasing the search breadth. The difference between these two algorithms is that itera- tive broadening extends its search breadth in a predetermined fashion, while complete forward pruning broadens its search depending on how heuristic pruning rules are weakened. If we treat the way that search breadth is ex- tended in a predefined way as a special heuristics, iterative broadening can then be considered as a special case of complete forward pruning. Complete forward pruning using the domain-independent pruning rules of Section 8.2 is symmetric to c:-DFBnB algorithm of Chapter 7. In c:- DFBnB algorithm, a node with a cost no greater than its parent's cost plus c: is treated as if it had the same cost as its parent, so as to force an early exploration of the node; in complete forward pruning, on the other hand, a node with cost greater than its parent's cost plus {j is considered as if it has an infinitely large cost, so as to postpone the exploration of the node. Anytime algorithms are important tools for problem solving in a real- time setting with resource constraints [24, 49, 159]. Although it is well known that many search methods, such as depth-first branch-and-bound and local search [90, 112], can be used as anytime algorithms, little work has been done to improve their anytime performance, except that of [41,117]. In [41], nonadmissible heuristic search runs as an anytime algorithm. Com- plete forward pruning is more similar to c:-DFBnB algorithm of Chapter 7, since both algorithm manipulate state space during their searches.",0.0,0.75382006

What is the formula for this rule?,"400 Chapter 13 Solids and Fluids Barometric Altitude Relation for Gases In deriving equation 13.8, we made use of the incompressibility of liquids. However, if the fluid is a gas, we cannot make this assumption. Let’s start again with a thin layer of fluid in a column of the fluid. The pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces is the negative of the weight of the thin layer of fluid divided by its area: p F A mg A Vg A hA g A g h =– =– =– =– ( ) =– . (13.10) The negative sign reflects the fact that the pressure decreases with increasing altitude (h), since the weight of the fluid column above the layer will be reduced. So far, nothing is dif- ferent from the derivation for the incompressible fluid. However, for compressible fluids, the density is proportional to the pressure:  0 0 = p p . (13.11) Strictly speaking, this relationship is true only for an ideal gas at constant temperature, as we will see in Chapter 19. However, if we combine equations 13.10 and 13.11, we obtain p h g p p =– . 0 0 Taking the limit as h → 0, we have dp dh g p p =– . 0 0 This is an example of a differential equation. We need to find a function whose derivative is proportional to the function itself, which leads us to an exponential function: p h p e h g p ( ) . – / = 0 0 0  (13.12) It is easy to convince yourself that equation 13.12 is indeed a solution to the preced- ing differential equation by simply taking the derivative with respect to h. Equation 13.12 is sometimes called the barometric pressure formula, and it relates the pressure to the altitude in gases. It applies only as long as the temperature does not change as a function of altitude and as long as the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant. (We will consider the effect of temperature change when we discuss the Ideal Gas Law in Chapter 19.) We can obtain a formula for the air density, , as a function of altitude by combining equations 13.11 and 13.12:    ( ) . – / h e h g p = 0 0 0 (13.13) Even though results obtained with this equation are only an approximation, they match actual atmospheric data fairly closely, as shown in Figure 13.19, where (h) was plotted with g = 9.81 m/s2, p0 = 1.01 · 105 Pa , the air pressure at sea level (h = 0), and 0 = 1.229 kg/m3, the air density at sea level. As you can see, the agreement is very close up to the top of the stratosphere, approximately 50 km above ground. Example 13.3 Air Pressure on Mount Everest As climbers approach the peak of Earth’s highest mountain, Mount Everest, they usually have to wear breathing equipment.

If we burn it in a car engine (right), a much larger portion (,30%) of DE is transferred as work that moves the car, with the rest released as heat that warms the car, exhaust gases, and surround- ing air. If we burn the octane in a lawn mower or a motorcycle, DE appears as other combinations of work and heat. Thus, q and w are not state functions because their values do depend on the path the system takes, but DE (the sum of q and w) does not. Pressure (P), volume (V), and temperature (T ) are some other state functions. Path independence means that changes in state functions—DE, DP, DV, and DT—depend only on the initial and final states. Summary of Section 6.1 •  Internal energy (E) is transferred as heat (q) when system and surroundings are at different temperatures or as work (w) when an object is moved by a force. •  Heat absorbed by a system (q . 0) or work done on a system (w . 0) increases the system’s E; heat released by a system (q , 0) or work done by a system (w , 0) decreases its E. The change in the internal energy is the sum of the heat and work: DE 5 q 1 w. Heat and work are measured in joules (J). •  Energy is always conserved: it can change from one form to another and move into or out of the system, but the total quantity of energy in the universe (system plus surroundings) is constant. •  The internal energy of a system is a state function and, thus, is independent of how the system attained that energy; therefore, the same overall DE can occur through any combination of q and w. 6.2 •  Enthalpy: Chemical Change at constant pressure Most physical and chemical changes occur at nearly constant atmospheric pressure—a reaction in an open flask, the freezing of a lake, a biochemical process in an organism. In this section, we discuss enthalpy, a thermodynamic variable that relates directly to energy changes at constant pressure. The Meaning of Enthalpy To determine DE, we must measure both heat and work. The two most important types of chemical work are electrical work, done by moving charged particles (Chapter 21), and pressure-volume work (PV work), the mechanical work done when the volume of the system changes in the presence of an external pressure (P). The quantity of PV work equals P times the change in volume (DV, or Vfinal 2 Vinitial). In an open flask (or in a cylinder with a weightless, frictionless piston) (Figure 6.5), a system of an expanding gas does PV work on the surroundings, so it has a negative sign: w 5 2PDV (6.4) For reactions at constant pressure, a thermodynamic variable called enthalpy (H) eliminates the need to measure PV work. The enthalpy of a system is defined as the internal energy plus the product of the pressure and volume:",0.0,-1.9902376

Example5 Find the derivative of 푒2푥by the chain rule and by the product rule. Solution Using the chain rule, we have 푑 푑푥(푒2푥) = 푒2푥⋅푑 푑푥(2푥) = 푒2푥⋅2 = 2푒2푥. Using the product rule, we write 푒2푥= 푒푥⋅푒푥. Then 푑 푑푥(푒2푥) = 푑 푑푥(푒푥푒푥) = ( 푑 푑푥(푒푥) ) 푒푥+ 푒푥( 푑 푑푥(푒푥) ) = 푒푥⋅푒푥+ 푒푥⋅푒푥= 2푒2푥.

A Lorenz curve shows the distribution of income by arraying incomes from lowest to highest on the horizontal axis and indicating the cumulative fraction of income earned by each frac- tion of households on the vertical axis. If the distribution of income were perfectly equal, a Lorenz curve would be a straight line because the first 20 percent of households would earn 20 percent of total income, the first 40 percent of households would earn 40 percent of total income, and so on.

Because the Lorenz curve for 1980 is closer to the line of perfect equality than the Lorenz curve for 2011, we know that income was more equally distributed in 1980 than in 2011. In panel (b), we show the Gini coefficient, which is equal to the area between the line of perfect income equality and the Lorenz curve—area A—divided by the whole area below the line of perfect equality—area A plus area B.

The U.S. price would have equaled the world price of $0.28 per pound. Because the sugar quota limits imports to 5.3 billion pounds (the bracket in the graph), the price of sugar in the United States rises to $0.53 per pound, and U.S. producers supply 15.9 billion pounds.

Accept the program or you will not pass your ‘exams’ which confirm your ‘degree’ of programming. It is tragic to think that many parents pressure their offspring to work hard at school to download the program and qualify for the next stage at college and university. The late, great, American comedian George Carlin said: ‘Here’s a bumper sticker I’d like to see: We are proud parents of a child who has resisted his teachers’ aĴempts to break his spirit and bend him to the will of his corporate masters.’ Well, the best of luck finding many of those, George. Then comes the moment to leave the formal programming years in academia and enter the ‘adult’ world of work. There you meet others in your chosen or prescribed arena who went through the same Postage Stamp Consensus program before you did. There is therefore overwhelming agreement between almost everyone on the basic foundations of Postage Stamp reality and the rejection, even contempt, of the few who have a mind of their own and are prepared to use it. This has two major effects. Firstly, the consensus confirms to the programmed that their download is really how things are. I mean, everyone knows that, right? Secondly, the arrogance and ignorance of Postage Stamp adherents ensure that anyone questioning the program will have unpleasant consequences for seeking their own truth and not picking their perceptions from the shelf marked: ‘Things you must believe without question and if you don’t you’re a dangerous lunatic conspiracy theorist and a harebrained nuĴer’.

The number and strength of carbon’s bonds lead to the property of catenation, the ability to bond to itself, which allows it to form a multitude of chemically and thermally stable chain, ring, and branched compounds. • Through the process of orbital hybridization (Section 11.1), carbon forms four bonds in virtually all its compounds, and they point in as many as four different directions. • The small size of carbon allows close approach to another atom and thus greater orbital overlap, so carbon forms relatively short, strong bonds. • The C¬C bond is short enough to allow side-to-side overlap of half-filled, unhybridized p orbitals and the formation of multiple bonds, which restrict rotation of attached groups. •  naming straight-chain alkanes (Section 2.8) • constitutional isomerism (Section 3.2) • DEN and bond polarity (Section 9.5) • resonance structures (Section 10.1) • VSEPR theory (Section 10.2) • orbital hybridization (Section 11.1) • s and p bonding (Section 11.2) •  types of intermolecular forces (Section 12.3) • properties of the Period 2 elements (Section 14.2) •  properties of the Group 4A(14) elements (Section 14.5)",0.0,-2.0461812

Disney also has a second source of profit from selling admission tickets to the park. Given the $26 price for ride tickets, what price would Disney be able to charge for admission tickets? Let’s assume the following for simplicity: The only reason people want admission to Disney World is to go on the rides, all consumers have the same individual demand curve for rides, and Disney knows what this demand curve is. This last assumption allows Disney to practice perfect price discrimination. More realistic assumptions would make the outcome of the analysis somewhat different but would not affect the main point of how Disney uses a two-part tariff to increase its profits. With these as- sumptions, we can use the concept of consumer surplus to calculate the maximum total amount consumers would be willing to pay for admission. Remember that con- sumer surplus is equal to the area below the demand curve and above the price line, shown by the dark-green triangle, A, in panel (a). The area represents the benefit to buyers from consuming the product.

Once ‘change agents’ have secured positions of hire and fire within any organisation things start to move very quickly. Personnel are then hired and fired on the basis of whether they will work towards the agenda the change agent represents. If they do they are rapidly promoted even though they may be incompetent. Those more qualified and skilled who are pre-Common Purpose ‘old school’ see their careers stall and even disappear. This has been happening for decades in every institution of state, police, ‘health’ and social services and all of them have been transformed as a result in their aĴitudes to their jobs and the public. Medical professions, including nursing, which were once vocations for the caring now employ many cold, callous and couldn’t give a shit personality types. The UKColumn investigation concluded: By blurring the boundaries between people, professions, public and private sectors, responsibility and accountability, Common Purpose encourages ‘graduates’ to believe that as new selected leaders, they can work together, outside of the established political and social structures, to achieve a paradigm shift or CHANGE – so called ‘Leading Beyond Authority’. In doing so, the allegiance of the individual becomes ‘reframed’ on CP colleagues and their NETWORK. Reframing the Face-Nappies Nowhere has this process been more obvious than in the police where recruitment of psychopaths and development of unquestioning mind-controlled group-thinkers have transformed law enforcement into a politically-correct ‘Woke’ joke and a travesty of what should be public service.

This has taken the form of skewing what is ‘taught’ to fit the Cult agenda and the omnipresent techniques of group-think to isolate non-believers and pressure them into line. There has always been a tendency to follow the herd, but we really are in a new world now in relation to that. We have parents who can see the ‘Covid’ hoax told by their children not to stop them wearing masks at school, being ‘Covid’ tested or having the ‘vaccine’ in fear of the peer-pressure consequences of being different. What is ‘peer-pressure’ if not pressure to conform to group-think? Renegade Minds never group-think and always retain a set of perceptions that are unique to them. Group-think is always underpinned by consequences for not group-thinking. Abuse now aimed at those refusing DNA-manipulating ‘Covid vaccines’ are a potent example of this. The biggest pressure to conform comes from the very group which is itself being manipulated. ‘I am programmed to be part of a hive mind and so you must be.’ Woke control structures in ‘education’ now apply to every mainstream organisation. Those at the top of the ‘education’ hierarchy (the Cult) decide the policy. This is imposed on governments through the Cult network; governments impose it on schools, colleges and universities; their leadership impose the policy on teachers and academics and they impose it on children and students. At any level where there is resistance, perhaps from a teacher or university lecturer, they are targeted by the authorities and oĞen fired. Students themselves regularly demand the dismissal of academics (increasingly few) at odds with the narrative that the students have been programmed to believe in. It is quite a thought that students who are being targeted by the Cult become so consumed by programmed group-think that they launch protests and demand the removal of those who are trying to push back against those targeting the students.

What is the definition of DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION?,"Long-lived assets are business assets acquired for use over one or more years. These assets are not intended for resale. Instead, they are considered “productive” assets in the sense they produce the goods or services the business then sells to customers. Examples include the computers Noodlecake Studios uses to make its game apps, the stores where Walmart sells merchandise, and the legal rights that restrict use of the American Eagle Outfitters logo. So when you hear the term “long-lived assets,” think more broadly than just rusty old equipment. This class of assets includes two major types: tangible and intangible. 1. Tangible assets. These are long-lived assets that have physical substance, which simply means you can see, touch, or kick them. The most prominent examples of tangible assets are land, buildings, machinery, vehicles, office equipment, and furniture and fixtures. These assets are typically grouped into a single line item on the balance sheet called Property, Plant, and Equipment. They are also known as fixed assets because they are often fixed in place. Cedar Fair’s tangible assets include roller coasters, hotels, and land in the western, midwestern, and northeastern United States. 2. Intangible assets. These long-lived assets have special rights but no physical sub stance. The existence of most intangible assets is indicated only by legal documents that describe their rights. Compared to the tangible assets you see in daily life, intangible assets are probably less familiar to you. For this reason, we’ll describe the various types of intangibles in detail later in this chapter. For now you can think of this category as including brand names, trademarks, and licensing rights such as the ones that allow Cedar Fair’s exclusive use of PEANUTS® characters through out its amusement parks until 2025. A third category of long-lived assets that are depleted over time, like an oil well or gold mine, is common in natural resource industries. Chapter Supplement 9A describes how to account for these natural resource assets.

What is the formula for this rule?,"605 19.6 Kinetic Theory of Gases distributed around the average speed, vave. However, the distribution is not symmetrical around vrms. A tail in the distribution extends to high velocities. You can also see that the most probable speed cor- responds to the maximum of the distribution. Figure 19.21 shows the Maxwell speed distribu- tion for nitrogen molecules at four different tempera- tures. As the temperature is increased, the Maxwell speed distribution gets wider. Consequently, the maximum value of f(v) has to get lower with increas- ing temperature, because the total area under the curve always equals 1, as required for a probability distribution. In addition, at a given temperature, the Maxwell speed distribution for lighter atoms or molecules is wider and has more of a high-speed tail than the dis- tribution for heavier atoms or molecules (Figure 19.22). Figure 19.22a shows the Maxwell speed distributions for hydrogen and nitrogen molecules plotted on a logarithmic scale at a temperature of 22 °C, which is characteristic of temperatures found at the surface of the Earth. How far the high-speed tails of these distributions extend is important to the composition of Earth’s atmosphere. As we saw in Chapter 12, the escape speed, ve, for any object near the surface of the Earth is 11.2 km/s. Thus, any air molecule that has at least this escape speed can leave Earth’s atmosphere. No gas atoms or molecules are near the escape speed at this temperature. How ever, hydrogen gas is light compared to the other gases in the Earth’s atmosphere and tends to move upward. The temperature of Earth’s atmosphere depends on the altitude. At an altitude of 100 km above the surface, the Earth’s atmosphere starts to become very warm and can reach temperatures of 1500 °C. This layer of the atmosphere is called the thermosphere. Figure 19.22b shows the Maxwell speed distributions for hydrogen and nitrogen mol- ecules plotted on a logarithmic scale at a temperature of 1500 °C. We can calculate the fraction of hydrogen molecules that will have a speed higher than the escape speed by eval- uating the integral for the Maxwell speed distribution from the escape speed to infinity: f v dv Fraction of H escaping = =7 10 =0.07%. v 2 =11.2 km/s ∞ –4 ∫ ( ) ⋅ Only a small fraction of the hydrogen molecules in the thermosphere have speeds above the escape speed. The hydrogen molecules with speeds above the escape speed will go out into space. The hydrogen molecules remaining behind have the same temperature as the rest of the thermosphere, and the speed distribution will reflect this temperature. Thus, over time Figure 19.21 ​ Maxwell speed distribution for N2 molecules at four different temperatures. 0.003 0.002 0.001 00 3000 2000 1000 N2 molecules T 750 K T 1650 K T 450 K T 150 K f (v) ((m/s)–1) v (m/s) Figure 19.22 ​ Maxwell speed distributions for hydrogen molecules and nitrogen molecules in the Earth’s atmosphere, plotted on a logarithmic scale: (a) at a temperature of 22 °C;",0.0,-3.0636656

What is the formula for this rule?,"316 4 / Number Theory and Cryptography Remark: With the steady increase of the speed of computers, the recommended size of the primes p and q used to produce a RSA public key has increased. But the larger n is, the slower RSA encryption and decryption become. When considering this tradeoff, the number of years a message needs to be remain secret is important. A more important consideration is that the development of quantum computing threatens the security of the RSA cryptosystem, because factorization algorithms have been developed for quantum computers that could then be used to quickly factor large primes. So, once quantum computing becomes practical, perhaps in the next 20 to 30 years, other public key cryptosystems that cannot be broken using quantum computing will need to be used. 4.6.5 RSA Encryption To encrypt messages using a particular key (n, e), we first translate a plaintext message M into sequences of integers. To do this, we first translate each plaintext letter into a two-digit number, using the same translation we employed for shift ciphers, with one key difference. That is, we include an initial zero for the letters A through J, so that A is translated into 00, B into 01, ... , and J into 09. Then, we concatenate these two-digit numbers into strings of dig- its. Next, we divide this string into equally sized blocks of 2N digits, where 2N is the largest even number such that the number 2525 ... 25 with 2N digits does not exceed n. (When neces- sary, we pad the plaintext message with dummy Xs to make the last block the same size as all other blocks.) After these steps, we have translated the plaintext message M into a sequence of integers m1, m2, ... , mk for some integer k. Encryption proceeds by transforming each block mi to a ciphertext block ci. This is done using the function c = me mod n. (To perform the encryption, we use an algorithm for fast modular exponentiation, such as Algo- rithm 5 in Section 4.2.) We leave the encrypted message as blocks of numbers and send these to the intended recipient. Because the RSA cryptosystem encrypts blocks of characters into blocks of characters, it is a block cipher. Example 8 illustrates how RSA encryption is performed. For practical reasons we use small primes p and q in this example, rather than primes with 300 or more digits. Although the cipher described in this example is not secure, it does illustrate the techniques used in the RSA cipher.",0.0,-5.237593

What is the formula for 5.1 What is the purpose of the antitrust laws? Who is in charge?,"There are only four electrons around Be and six around B. Surrounding halogen atoms don’t form multiple bonds to the central atoms to give them an octet, because the halogens are much more electronegative. Formal charges make the following struc- tures unlikely: B F F F ( 1) (0) (0) Be Cl Cl ( 2) ( 1) ( 1) ( 1) (Some data for BF3 show a shorter than expected B¬F bond. Shorter bonds indi- cate double-bond character, so the structure with the B“F bond may be a minor contributor to a resonance hybrid.) Electron-deficient atoms often attain an octet by forming additional bonds in reactions. When BF3 reacts with ammonia, for instance, a compound forms in which boron attains an octet:* B F F F N H H H B N H H H F F F ± £ (0) (0) ( 1) ( 1) Molecules with Odd-Electron Atoms ​ A few molecules contain a central atom with an odd number of valence electrons, so they cannot have all their electrons in pairs. Most have a central atom from an odd-numbered group, such as N [Group 5A(15)] or Cl [Group 7A(17)]. These are called free radicals, species that contain a lone (unpaired) electron, which makes them paramagnetic (Section 8.4) and extremely reactive (such reactivity can be especially harmful to biomolecules). Consider the free radical nitrogen dioxide, NO2, a major contributor to urban smog that is formed when the NO in auto exhaust is oxidized. NO2 has several reso- nance forms. Two differ in terms of which O atom is doubly bonded, as in the case of ozone. Two others have the lone electron residing on the N or on an O, so the resonance hybrid has the lone electron delocalized over these two atoms: N O O lone electron ( 1) (0) ( 1) N O O (0) (0) (0) ¢ £ But the form with the lone electron on N (left) may be more important because of the way NO2 reacts. Free radicals react with each other to pair up their lone electrons. When two NO2 molecules react, the lone electrons pair up to form the N¬N bond in dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) and each N attains an octet: N N O O O O 1 N N O O O O ± £ Apparently, in this case, the lone electron spends most of its time on N, so formal charge is not very useful for picking the most important resonance form; we’ll see other cases below. Expanded Valence Shells Many molecules (and ions) have more than eight valence electrons around the central atom. An atom expands its valence shell to form more bonds, which releases energy. The central atom must be large and have empty orbitals that can hold the additional pairs. Therefore, expanded valence shells (levels) occur only with nonmetals from Period 3 or higher because they have d orbitals available. Such a central atom may be bonded to more than four atoms or to four or fewer.",0.0,-1.9202691

To turn on a subpixel, a voltage from both a column and a row must be applied. Thus, the subpixels are turned on one row at a time. With the voltage for one row on, the voltages for the subpixels in the desired columns are turned on. A small capacitor holds the voltage until the row is turned on again. A high-definition 1080p LCD screen is scanned 60 times a second, producing a com- plete image in each scan. On a high-definition 1080i screen, every other row of the image is scanned 60 times a second and then the two images are interlaced. Another high- definition standard is 720p, which scans 720 rows 60 times a second with a horizontal resolution of 1280 pixels. The 720p and 1080i standards are in common use in television broadcasting. The standard resolution for a television image is 480i, with every other row being updated 60 times a second and producing 640 columns of pixels. Viewing a 3D movie also involves the use of polarization filters. Moviegoers are equipped with glasses that have different polarization filters built into each lens. The projec- tion equipment generates two different images with different polarizations on the screen. These images are also slightly offset from each other, and the viewer’s brain constructs the 3D illusion by combining the two offset images. Older projection systems use linear polar- ization filters with polarization directions perpendicular to each other. However, this type of system yields diminished 3D effects when viewers tilt their heads sideways. Modern 3D movie projection equipment uses circular polarization filters. Circular polarized light comes in two orthogonal varieties, left-circular and right-circular. Circular polarization filters work just like linear polarization filters, subject to a corresponding ver- sion of the Law of Malus. The 3D viewing glasses used with this modern equipment have one lens that passes left-circular and one lens that passes right-circular polarized light. This type of glasses produces 3D effects that are not affected when viewers tilt their heads. There is one important difference between linearly polarized and circular polarized light: Linear polarized light remains in the same state of polarization after being reflected by a mirror, whereas circular polarized light changes its state from left-circular polarized to right-circular polarized, or vice versa. Figure 31.26 shows an interesting experiment you can do yourself: Hold a pair of 3D viewing glasses with circular polarization in front of a mirror and take a picture through one of the lenses. You can see that the light passing through the left lens, reflecting off the mirror, and then passing through the same lens again gets totally attenuated. In contrast, the light passing through the left lens, reflecting off the mirror, and then passing through the right lens is transmitted without being attenuated. If 3D glasses with linear polarization filters were used for this experiment instead, the light would pass through the lenses at half of its original intensity (equation 31.30), and the entire image of the camera phone could be seen in the mirror.

State the 5.4 THEOREMS ABOUT DEFINITE INTEGRALS.,"580 Chapter 10 APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS USING SERIES It appears that the approximations converge to the true value, cos(휋∕2) = 0, very rapidly. Now take a value of 푥somewhat farther away from 0, say 푥= 휋; then cos 휋= −1 and 푃2(휋) = 1 −(휋)2∕2! = −3.93480 ... 푃4(휋) = ⋯ = 0.12391 ... 푃6(휋) = ⋯ = −1.21135 ... 푃8(휋) = ⋯ = −0.97602 ... 푃10(휋) = ⋯ = −1.00183 ... 푃12(휋) = ⋯ = −0.99990 ... 푃14(휋) = ⋯ = −1.000004 ... . We see that the rate of convergence is somewhat slower; it takes a 14th-degree polynomial to approx- imate cos 휋as accurately as an 8th-degree polynomial approximates cos(휋∕2). If 푥were taken still farther away from 0, then we would need still more terms to obtain as accurate an approximation of cos 푥. Exercise 18 on page 546 uses the ratio test to show that the Taylor series for cos 푥converges for all values of 푥. To show that its sum is indeed cos 푥, we use Theorem 10.3. This justifies our writing the equality: cos 푥= 1 −푥2 2! + 푥4 4! −푥6 6! + 푥8 8! −⋯ for all 푥. Showing That the Taylor Series for cos 풙Converges to cos 풙 The Lagrange error bound in Theorem 10.3 allows us to see if the Taylor series for a function con- verges to that function. In the series for cos 푥, the odd powers are missing, so we assume 푛is even and write 퐸푛(푥) = cos 푥−푃푛(푥) = cos 푥− ( 1 −푥2 2! + ⋯+ (−1)푛∕2푥푛 푛! ) , giving cos 푥= 1 −푥2 2! + ⋯+ (−1)푛∕2푥푛 푛! + 퐸푛(푥). Thus, for the Taylor series to converge to cos 푥, we must have 퐸푛(푥) →0 as 푛→∞. Showing 푬풏(풙) →0 as 풏→∞ Proof Since 푓(푥) = cos 푥, the (푛+ 1)st derivative, 푓(푛+1)(푥), is ± cos 푥or ± sin 푥, no matter what 푛is.",0.0,-1.6922514

What is the formula for this rule?,"I thought I’d use a controversial subheading to get things moving in terms of our response to global fascism. What do you mean ‘don’t fight’? What do you mean ‘walk away’? We’ve got to fight. We can’t walk away. Well, it depends what we mean by fight and walk away. If fighting means physical combat we are playing Wetiko’s game and falling for its trap. It wants us to get angry, aggressive, and direct hate and hostility at the enemy we think we must fight. Every war, every baĴle, every conflict, has been fought with Wetiko leading both sides. It’s what it does. Wetiko wants a fight, anywhere, any place. Just hit me, son, so I can hit you back. Wetiko hits Wetiko and Wetiko hits Wetiko in return. I am very forthright as you can see in exposing Wetikos of the Cult, but I don’t hate them. I refuse to hate them. It’s what they want. What you hate you become. What you fight you become. Wokers, ‘anti-haters’ and ‘anti-fascists’ prove this every time they reach for their keyboards or don their balaclavas. By walk away I mean to disengage from Wetiko which includes ceasing to cooperate with its tyranny. Paul Levy says of Wetiko: The way to ‘defeat’ evil is not to try to destroy it (for then, in playing evil’s game, we have already lost), but rather, to find the invulnerable place within ourselves where evil is unable to vanquish us – this is to truly ‘win’ our battle with evil. Wetiko is everywhere in human society and it’s been on steroids since the ‘Covid’ hoax. Every shouting match over wearing masks has Wetiko wearing a mask and Wetiko not wearing one. It’s an electrical circuit of push and resist, push and resist, with Wetiko pushing and resisting. Each polarity is Wetiko empowering itself. Dictionary definitions of ‘resist’ include ‘opposing, refusing to accept or comply with’ and the word to focus on is ‘opposing’. What form does this take – seĴing police cars alight or ‘refusing to accept or comply with’? The former is Wetiko opposing Wetiko while the other points the way forward. This is the difference between those aggressively demanding that government fascism must be obeyed who stand in stark contrast to the great majority of Pushbackers.

What is the definition of 2.1 Give brief definitions of the following concepts:?,"665 21.5 Electrostatic Force—Coulomb’s Law Electrostatic Precipitator An application of electrostatic charging and electrostatic forces is the cleaning of emissions from coal-fired power plants. A device called an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) is used to remove ash and other particulates produced when coal is burned to generate electricity. The operation of this device is illustrated in Figure 21.18. The ESP consists of wires and plates, with the wires held at a high negative voltage relative to the series of plates held at a positive voltage. (Here the term voltage is used colloquially; in Chapter 23, the concept will be defined in terms of electric potential dif- ference.) In Figure 21.18, the exhaust gas from the coal-burning process enters the ESP from the left. Particulates passing near the wires pick up a negative charge. These par- ticles are then attracted to one of the positive plates and stick there. The gas continues through the ESP, leaving the ash and other particulates behind. The accumulated material is then shaken off the plates to a hamper below. This waste can be used for many pur- poses, including construction materials and fertilizer. Figure 21.19 shows an example of a coal-fired power plant that incorporates an ESP.

What is the formula for this rule?,"116 Chapter 4 Force diagonal in Figure 4.19), because the kinetic friction force is bigger than the external force. Eventually, the object comes to rest because of the kinetic friction, and the external force is not sufficient to move it anymore. Then static friction takes over, and the friction force is reduced proportionally to the external force until both reach zero. The blue line in Figure 4.19 illustrates this dependence of the friction force on the external force. Where the blue line and the red line overlap, this is indicated by alternating blue and red dashes. The most interesting feature of Figure 4.19 is that the blue and red lines do not coincide between kN and sN. Let’s return to the attempt to move a refrigerator across the kitchen floor. Initially, the refrigerator sits on the floor, and the static friction force resists your effort to move it. Once you push hard enough, the refrigerator jars into motion. In this process, the friction force follows the red path in Figure 4.19. Once the refrigerator moves, you can push less hard and still keep it moving. If you push with less force so that it moves with constant velocity, the external force you apply follows the blue path in Figure 4.19 until it is reduced to Fext = kN. Then the friction force and the force you apply to the fridge add up to zero, and there is no net force acting on the refrigerator, allowing it to move with constant velocity.

Fg mg cos mg sin N y x fk Example 4.6 Realistic Snowboarding Let’s reconsider the snowboarding situation from Solved Problem 4.1, but now include fric- tion. A snowboarder moves down a slope for which  = 22°. Suppose the coefficient of kinetic friction between his board and the snow is 0.21, and his velocity, which is along the direction of the slope, is measured as 8.3 m/s at a given instant. Problem 1 Assuming a constant slope, what will be the speed of the snowboarder along the direction of the slope when he is 100 m farther down the slope? Solution 1 Figure 4.20 shows a free-body diagram for this problem. The gravitational force points downward and has magnitude mg, where m is the mass of the snowboarder and his equipment. We choose convenient x- and y-axes parallel and perpendicu- lar to the slope, respectively, as indicated in Figure 4.20. The angle  that the slope makes with the horizontal (22° in this case) also appears in the decomposition of the components of the gravitational force parallel and perpendicular to the slope. (This analysis is a general feature of any inclined-plane problem.) The force component along the plane is then mg sin , as shown in Figure 4.20. The normal force is given by N = mg cos , and the force of kinetic friction is fk = –kmg cos , with the minus sign indicating that the force is acting in the negative x-direction, in our chosen coordinate system. We thus get for the total force component in the x-direction: mg mg ma a g sin – cos = = (sin – cos ). x x k k ⇒ Here we have used Newton’s Second Law, Fx = max, in the first line.",0.0,-5.1380825
What is the formula for 3.3 THE PRODUCT AND QUOTIENT RULES?,"Analyze government policies to achieve economic efficiency in a market with an externality. Figure 5.5 When There Is a Negative Externality, a Tax Can Lead to the Efficient Level of Output Because utilities do not bear the cost of acid rain, they produce electricity beyond the ec- onomically efficient level. If the government imposes a tax equal to the cost of acid rain, the utilities will internalize the externality. As a consequence, the supply curve will shift up, from S1 to S2. The market equilibrium quantity changes from QMarket, where an inefficiently high level of electricity is pro- duced, to QEfficient, the economically ef- ficient equilibrium quantity.

"What is the formula for 9.3 Angular Velocity, Angular Frequency, and Period?","We have seen that the change of an object’s linear coordinates in time is its velocity. Simi- larly, the change of an object’s angular coordinate in time is its angular velocity. The aver- age magnitude of the angular velocity is defined as = = 2 1 2 1 – – . t t t This definition uses the notation     1 1 2 2 ≡ ≡ ( ) ( ). t t and The horizontal bar above the symbol  for angular velocity again indicates a time average. By taking the limit of this expression as the time interval approaches zero, we find the instantaneous value of the magnitude of the angular velocity: = = lim lim . t t t d dt → → 0 0 ≡ (9.8) The most common unit of angular velocity is radians per second (rad/s); degrees per second is not generally used. Angular velocity is a vector. Its direction is that of an axis through the center of the circular path and perpendicular to the plane of the circle. (This axis is a rotation axis, as we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 10.) This definition allows for two possibilities for the direction in which the vector  can point: up or down, parallel or antiparallel to the axis of rotation. A right-hand rule helps us decide which is the correct direction: When the fingers point in the direction of rotation along the circle’s circumference, the thumb points in the direction of , as shown in Figure 9.8. Angular velocity measures how fast the angle  changes in time. Another quantity also specifies how fast this angle changes in time—the frequency, f. For example, the rpm number on the tachometer in your car indicates how many times per minute the engine cycles and thus specifies the frequency of engine revolution. Figure 9.9 shows a tachometer, with the units specified as “1/min × 1000”; the engine hits the red line at 6000 revolutions per minute. Thus, the frequency, f, measures cycles per unit time, instead of radians per unit time as the angular velocity does. The frequency is related to the magnitude of the angular velocity, , by f f = = 2 2 ⇔ . (9.9) This relationship makes sense because one complete turn around a circle requires an angle change of 2 rad. (Be careful—both frequency and angular velocity have the same unit of inverse seconds and can be easily confused.)

What is the formula for this rule?,"Figure 2.12 A solid with a varying cross-section. We want to divide S into slices perpendicular to the x-axis. As we see later in the chapter, there may be times when we want to slice the solid in some other direction—say, with slices perpendicular to the y-axis. The decision of which way to slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the computations can get quite messy. Later in the chapter, we examine some of these situations in detail and look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the purposes of this section, however, we use slices perpendicular to the x-axis. Because the cross-sectional area is not constant, we let A(x) represent the area of the cross-section at point x. Now let P = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨x0, x1 ..., Xn ⎫ ⎭ ⎬be a regular partition of ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦, and for i = 1, 2,...n, let Si represent the slice of S stretching from xi −1 to xi. The following figure shows the sliced solid with n = 3. Figure 2.13 The solid S has been divided into three slices perpendicular to the x-axis. Finally, for i = 1, 2,...n, let xi * be an arbitrary point in [xi −1, xi]. Then the volume of slice Si can be estimated by V⎛ ⎝Si ⎞ ⎠≈A⎛ ⎝xi * ⎞ ⎠Δx. Adding these approximations together, we see the volume of the entire solid S can be approximated by V(S) ≈∑ i = 1 n A⎛ ⎝xi * ⎞ ⎠Δx. By now, we can recognize this as a Riemann sum, and our next step is to take the limit as n →∞. Then we have V(S) = lim n →∞∑ i = 1 n A⎛ ⎝xi * ⎞ ⎠Δx = ∫ a b A(x)dx.

Thus, f(x) is continuous over each of the intervals (−∞, −2), (−2, 0), and (0, +∞). Example 2.34 Continuity over an Interval State the interval(s) over which the function f(x) = 4 −x2 is continuous. Solution From the limit laws, we know that lim x →a 4 −x2 = 4 −a2 for all values of a in (−2, 2). We also know that lim x →−2+ 4 −x2 = 0 exists and lim x →2−4 −x2 = 0 exists. Therefore, f(x) is continuous over the interval [−2, 2]. State the interval(s) over which the function f(x) = x + 3 is continuous. The Composite Function Theorem allows us to expand our ability to compute limits. In particular, this theorem ultimately allows us to demonstrate that trigonometric functions are continuous over their domains.

In the second example, Dell’s managers can conclude that TruImage’s threat to reject a $20-per-copy contract is not credible. The Five Competitive Forces Model We have seen that the number of competitors in an industry affects a firm’s ability to charge a price above average cost and earn an economic profit. The number of firms is not the only determinant of the level of competition in an industry, however. Michael Porter of the Harvard Business School has drawn on the research of a number of econo- mists to develop a model that shows how five competitive forces determine the overall level of competition in an industry. Figure 14.8 illustrates Porter’s model. We now look at each of the five competitive forces: (1) competition from existing firms, (2) the threat from potential entrants, (3) competition from substitute goods or services, (4) the bargaining power of buyers, and (5) the bargaining power of suppliers.

What is the formula for this rule?,"This section discusses the root-mean-square values of currents and voltages, rather than the maximum or instantaneous values. The result obtained for the power is always the average power when root-mean-square values are used. This practice is the convention normally followed by scientists, engineers, and electricians dealing with AC circuits. In an AC circuit that has only a resistor, the phase constant is zero. Thus, we can express the power as P IV = . (30.41) For a given power delivered to a circuit, the application dictates the choice of high current or high voltage. For example, to provide enough power to operate a computer or a vacuum cleaner, using a high voltage might be dangerous. The design of electric generators is com- plicated by the use of high voltages. Therefore, in these devices, lower voltages and higher currents are advantageous. However, the transmission of electric power requires the opposite condition. The power dissipated in a transmission line is given by P = I2R. Thus, the power lost in a line, like those in Figure 30.32a is proportional to the square of the current in the line. As an example, consider a power plant that produces 500. MW of power. If the power is transmit- ted at 350. kV, the current in the power lines will be ⋅ ⋅ I P V = = 500. MW 350. kV = 5.00 10 W 3.50 10 V =1.43 kA. 8 5 If the total resistance of the power lines is 50. , the power lost in the transmission lines is P I R = = 1.43 kA 50.0 =102.MW, 2 2  ( ) ( ) or about 20% of the generated power. A similar calculation would show that transmitting the power at 200. kV instead of 350. kV would increase the power loss by a factor of 3.1. Thus, approximately 60% of the power generated would be lost in transmission. This is why the transmission of electric power is always done at the highest possible voltage. The ability to change voltage allows electric power to be generated and used at low, safe volt- ages but transmitted at the highest practical voltage. Alternating currents and voltages are trans- formed from high to low values by a device called, appropriately, a transformer.

What is the formula for this rule?,"In this section we examine exponential and logarithmic functions. We use the properties of these functions to solve equations involving exponential or logarithmic terms, and we study the meaning and importance of the number e. We also define hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, which involve combinations of exponential and logarithmic functions. (Note that we present alternative definitions of exponential and logarithmic functions in the chapter Applications of Integrations, and prove that the functions have the same properties with either definition.) Exponential Functions Exponential functions arise in many applications. One common example is population growth. For example, if a population starts with P0 individuals and then grows at an annual rate of 2%, its population after 1 year is P(1) = P0 + 0.02P0 = P0(1 + 0.02) = P0(1.02). Its population after 2 years is P(2) = P(1) + 0.02P(1) = P(1)(1.02) = P0 (1.02)2. In general, its population after t years is P(t) = P0 (1.02)t, which is an exponential function. More generally, any function of the form f(x) = bx, where b > 0, b ≠1, is an exponential function with base b and exponent x. Exponential functions have constant bases and variable exponents. Note that a function of the form f(x) = xb for some constant b is not an exponential function but a power function. To see the difference between an exponential function and a power function, we compare the functions y = x2 and y = 2x. In Table 1.10, we see that both 2x and x2 approach infinity as x →∞. Eventually, however, 2x becomes larger than x2 and grows more rapidly as x →∞. In the opposite direction, as x →−∞, x2 →∞, whereas 2x →0.

Suppose that ∑ n = 0 ∞ an xn has an interval of convergence of (−1, 1). Find the interval of convergence of ∑ n = 0 ∞ an ⎛ ⎝x 2 ⎞ ⎠ n . In the next example, we show how to use Combining Power Series and the power series for a function f to construct power series for functions related to f. Specifically, we consider functions related to the function f(x) = 1 1 −x and we use the fact that 1 1 −x = ∑ n = 0 ∞ xn = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ⋯ for |x| < 1. Example 6.5 Constructing Power Series from Known Power Series Use the power series representation for f(x) = 1 1 −x combined with Combining Power Series to construct a power series for each of the following functions.

What is the formula for 2011 Scott Cunningham/Getty Images; 3.17: © W.?,"Algorithms M any problems can be solved by considering them as special cases of general problems. For instance, consider the problem of locating the largest integer in the sequence 101, 12, 144, 212, 98. This is a specific case of the problem of locating the largest integer in a se- quence of integers. To solve this general problem we must give an algorithm, which specifies a sequence of steps used to solve this general problem. We will study algorithms for solving many different types of problems in this book. For example, in this chapter we will introduce algo- rithms for two of the most important problems in computer science, searching for an element in a list and sorting a list so its elements are in some prescribed order, such as increasing, decreas- ing, or alphabetic. Later in the book we will develop algorithms that find the greatest common divisor of two integers, that generate all the orderings of a finite set, that find the shortest path between nodes in a network, and for solving many other problems. We will also introduce the notion of an algorithmic paradigm, which provides a general method for designing algorithms. In particular we will discuss brute-force algorithms, which find solutions using a straightforward approach without introducing any cleverness. We will also discuss greedy algorithms, a class of algorithms used to solve optimization problems. Proofs are important in the study of algorithms. In this chapter we illustrate this by proving that a particular greedy algorithm always finds an optimal solution. One important consideration concerning an algorithm is its computational complexity, which measures the processing time and computer memory required by the algorithm to solve problems of a particular size. To measure the complexity of algorithms we use big-O and big- Theta notation, which we develop in this chapter. We will illustrate the analysis of the complex- ity of algorithms in this chapter, focusing on the time an algorithm takes to solve a problem. Furthermore, we will discuss what the time complexity of an algorithm means in practical and theoretical terms. 3.1 Algorithms 3.1.1 Introduction There are many general classes of problems that arise in discrete mathematics. For instance: given a sequence of integers, find the largest one; given a set, list all its subsets; given a set of integers, put them in increasing order; given a network, find the shortest path between two vertices. When presented with such a problem, the first thing to do is to construct a model that translates the problem into a mathematical context. Discrete structures used in such mod- els include sets, sequences, and functions—structures discussed in Chapter 2—as well as such other structures as permutations, relations, graphs, trees, networks, and finite state machines— concepts that will be discussed in later chapters. Setting up the appropriate mathematical model is only part of the solution. To complete the solution, a method is needed that will solve the general problem using the model. Ideally, what is required is a procedure that follows a sequence of steps that leads to the desired answer. Such a sequence of steps is called an algorithm. Definition 1 An algorithm is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing a computation or for solving a problem. 201",0.0,-7.267497

What is the formula for this rule?,"420 C H A P T E R 1 3 Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Analysis W e saw in Chapter 10 that the U.S. economy has experienced a long-run upward trend in real GDP. This upward trend has resulted in the standard of living in the United States being much higher today than it was 50 years ago. In the short run, however, real GDP fluctuates around this long-run upward trend because of the business cycle. Fluctuations in GDP lead to fluctuations in em- ployment. These fluctuations in real GDP and employment are the most visible and dra- matic part of the business cycle. During recessions, we are more likely to see factories close, small businesses declare bankruptcy, and workers lose their jobs. During expansions, we are more likely to see new businesses open and new jobs created. In addition to these changes in output and employment, the business cycle causes changes in wages and prices. Some firms react to a decline in sales by cutting back on production, but they may also cut the prices they charge and the wages they pay. Other firms respond to a recession by raising prices and workers’ wages by less than they otherwise would have. In this chapter, we expand our story of the business cycle by developing the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model. This model will help us analyze the effects of reces- sions and expansions on production, employment, and prices. Aggregate Demand To understand what happens during the business cycle, we need an explanation of why real GDP, the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate fluctuate. We have already seen that fluctuations in the unemployment rate are caused mainly by fluctuations in real GDP. In this chapter, we use the aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to explain short- run fluctuations in real GDP and the price level. As Figure 13.1 shows, real GDP and the price level in this model are determined in the short run by the intersection of the aggre- gate demand curve and the aggregate supply curve. Fluctuations in real GDP and the price level are caused by shifts in the aggregate demand curve or in the aggregate supply curve. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level and the quantity of real GDP demanded by households, firms, and the government. The short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the relationship in the short run be- tween the price level and the quantity of real GDP supplied by firms. The aggregate de- mand and short-run aggregate supply curves in Figure 13.1 look similar to the individual market demand and supply curves we studied in Chapter 3. However, because these curves apply to the whole economy, rather than to just a single market, the aggregate de- mand and aggregate supply model is very different from the model of demand and sup- ply in individual markets. Because we are dealing with the economy as a whole, we need",0.0,-4.6846185

State the THEOREM 4.,"2.6 Figure 2.17 The graph of f(x) = sin(1/x) oscillates rapidly between −1 and 1 as x approaches 0. Use a table of functional values to evaluate lim x →2|x2 −4| x −2 , if possible. One-Sided Limits Sometimes indicating that the limit of a function fails to exist at a point does not provide us with enough information about the behavior of the function at that particular point. To see this, we now revisit the function g(x) = |x −2|/(x −2) introduced at the beginning of the section (see Figure 2.12(b)). As we pick values of x close to 2, g(x) does not approach a single value, so the limit as x approaches 2 does not exist—that is, lim x →2g(x) DNE. However, this statement alone does not give us a complete picture of the behavior of the function around the x-value 2. To provide a more accurate description, we introduce the idea of a one-sided limit. For all values to the left of 2 (or the negative side of 2), g(x) = −1. Thus, as x approaches 2 from the left, g(x) approaches −1. Mathematically, we say that the limit as x approaches 2 from the left is −1. Symbolically, we express this idea as lim x →2−g(x) = −1. Similarly, as x approaches 2 from the right (or from the positive side), g(x) approaches 1. Symbolically, we express this idea as lim x →2+ g(x) = 1. We can now present an informal definition of one-sided limits. Definition We define two types of one-sided limits. Limit from the left: Let f(x) be a function defined at all values in an open interval of the form z, and let L be a real number. If the values of the function f(x) approach the real number L as the values of x (where x < a) approach the number a, then we say that L is the limit of f(x) as x approaches a from the left. Symbolically, we express this idea as Chapter 2 | Limits 145",0.0,-0.5154531

What is the formula for this rule?,"Step 5: Calculate the first derivative: f′(x) = (x −1)(2x) −x2 (1) (x −1)2 = x2 −2x (x −1)2. We have f′(x) = 0 when x2 −2x = x(x −2) = 0. Therefore, x = 0 and x = 2 are critical points. Since f is undefined at x = 1, we need to divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), and (2, ∞), and choose a test point from each interval to evaluate the sign of f′(x) in each of these smaller intervals. For example, let x = −1, x = 1 2, x = 3 2, and x = 3 be the test points as shown in the following table. Interval Test Point Sign of f′(x) = x2 −2x (x −1)2 = x(x −2) (x −1)2 Conclusion (−∞, 0) x = −1 (−)(−)/ + = + f is increasing. (0, 1) x = 1/2 (+)(−)/ + = − f is decreasing. (1, 2) x = 3/2 (+)(−)/ + = − f is decreasing. (2, ∞) x = 3 (+)(+)/ + = + f is increasing. From this table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = 0 and a local minimum at x = 2. The value of f at the local maximum is f(0) = 0 and the value of f at the local minimum is f(2) = 4. Therefore, (0, 0) and (2, 4) are important points on the graph. Step 6: Calculate the second derivative: f′′(x) = (x −1)2 (2x −2) −⎛ ⎝x2 −2x⎞ ⎠ ⎛ ⎝2(x −1) ⎞ ⎠ (x −1)4 = (x −1)⎡ ⎣(x −1)(2x −2) −2⎛ ⎝x2 −2x⎞ ⎠ ⎤ ⎦ (x −1)4 = (x −1)(2x −2) −2⎛ ⎝x2 −2x⎞ ⎠ (x −1)3 = 2x2 −4x + 2 −⎛ ⎝2x2 −4x⎞ ⎠ (x −1)3 = 2 (x −1)3.

In other words, Cowan says, these particles called ‘measles viruses’ are simply and clearly breakdown products of the starved and poisoned tissue. For measles ‘virus’ see all ‘viruses’ including the so-called ‘Covid virus’. Enders, the ‘Father of Modern Vaccines’, also said: There is a potential risk in employing cultures of primate cells for the production of vaccines composed of attenuated virus, since the presence of other agents possibly latent in primate tissues cannot be definitely excluded by any known method. Cowan further quotes from a paper published in the journal Viruses in May, 2020, while the ‘Covid pandemic’ was well underway in the media if not in reality. ‘EVs’ here refers to particles of genetic debris from our own tissues, such as exosomes of which more in a moment: ‘The remarkable resemblance between EVs and viruses has caused quite a few problems in the studies focused on the analysis of EVs released during viral infections.’ Later the paper adds that to date a reliable method that can actually guarantee a complete separation (of EVs from viruses) DOES NOT EXIST. This was published at a time when a fairy tale ‘virus’ was claimed in total certainty to be causing a fairy tale ‘viral disease’ called ‘Covid-19’ – a fairy tale that was already well on the way to transforming human society in the image that the Cult has worked to achieve for so long. Cowan concludes his article: To summarize, there is no scientific evidence that pathogenic viruses exist. What we think of as ‘viruses’ are simply the normal breakdown products of dead and dying tissues and cells. When we are well, we make fewer of these particles; when we are starved, poisoned, suffocated by wearing masks, or afraid, we make more. There is no engineered virus circulating and making people sick. People in laboratories all over the world are making genetically modified products to make people sick. These are called vaccines.

What happens when you change the soĞware in a computer? Everything changes. For this reason the Cult is preparing a production line of mRNA ‘Covid vaccines’ and a long list of excuses to use them as with all the ‘variants’ of a ‘virus’ never shown to exist. The plan is further to transfer the mRNA technique to other vaccines mostly given to children and young people. The cumulative consequences will be a transformation of human DNA through a constant infusion of synthetic genetic material which will kill many and change the rest. Now consider that governments that have given emergency approval for a vaccine that’s not a vaccine; never been approved for humans before; had no testing worth the name; and the makers have been given immunity from prosecution for any deaths or adverse effects suffered by the public. The UK government awarded permanent legal indemnity to itself and its employees for harm done when a patient is being treated for ‘Covid-19’ or ‘suspected Covid-19’.

In general, Sk = ⎛ ⎝1 −1 2 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝1 2 −1 3 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝1 3 −1 4 ⎞ ⎠+ ⋯+ ⎛ ⎝1 k − 1 k + 1 ⎞ ⎠= 1 − 1 k + 1. We notice that the middle terms cancel each other out, leaving only the first and last terms. In a sense, the series collapses like a spyglass with tubes that disappear into each other to shorten the telescope. For this reason, we call a series that has this property a telescoping series. For this series, since Sk = 1 −1/(k + 1) and 1/(k + 1) →0 as k →∞, the sequence of partial sums converges to 1, and therefore the series converges to 1. Definition A telescoping series is a series in which most of the terms cancel in each of the partial sums, leaving only some of the first terms and some of the last terms. For example, any series of the form ∑ n = 1 ∞ ⎡ ⎣bn −bn + 1 ⎤ ⎦= ⎛ ⎝b1 −b2 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝b2 −b3 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝b3 −b4 ⎞ ⎠+ ⋯ is a telescoping series. We can see this by writing out some of the partial sums. In particular, we see that S1 = b1 −b2 S2 = ⎛ ⎝b1 −b2 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝b2 −b3 ⎞ ⎠= b1 −b3 S3 = ⎛ ⎝b1 −b2 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝b2 −b3 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝b3 −b4 ⎞ ⎠= b1 −b4. In general, the kth partial sum of this series is Sk = b1 −bk + 1. Since the kth partial sum can be simplified to the difference of these two terms, the sequence of partial sums ⎧ ⎩ ⎨Sk ⎫ ⎭ ⎬will converge if and only if the sequence ⎧ ⎩ ⎨bk + 1 ⎫ ⎭ ⎬converges.",1.0,0.3494958

Note that for   0, d ≈ 0. The shape of the curve of the amplitude A, as a function of the driving angular speed, d, is called a resonance shape, and it is characteristic of all resonance phenomena. When d = 0 2 2 2 – , the driving angular speed is called the resonant angular speed; A is close to a maximum at this angular speed. In Figure 14.29, A is plotted from equation 14.33 for 0 = 3 s–1 and three values of the damping angular speed, . As the damping gets weaker, the resonance shape becomes sharper. You can see that in every case, the amplitude curve reaches its maximum at a value of d slightly below 0 = 3 s–1. The phase angle  in equation 14.32 depends on the driving angular speed as well as on the damping and intrinsic angular speeds: = d d 2 2 1 0 2 2 – tan – . –               (14.34) The phase shift as a function of the driving angular speed is graphed in Figure 14.30 with the same parameters used in Figure 14.29. You can see that for small driving angular speeds, the forced oscillation follows the driving in phase. As the driving angular speed increases, the phase difference begins to grow and reaches /2 at d = 0. For driving angular speeds much larger than the resonant angular speed, the phase shift approaches . The lower the damping angular speed, , the steeper the transition of the phase shift from 0 to  becomes. A practical note is in order at this point: The solution presented in equation 14.32 is usually only reached after some time. The full solution for the differential equation for damped and driven oscillation (equation 14.31) is given by a combination of equations 14.20 and 14.32. During the transition time, the effect of the particular initial conditions for the system is damped out, and the solution given by equation 14.32 is approached asymptotically. Figure 14.31 shows motion of a system that is driven with a driving angular speed of d = 1.2 s–1 and an acceleration of F/m = 0.6 m/s2. The system has an intrinsic angular speed of 0 = 2.2 s–1 and a damping angular speed of  = 0.4 s–1 and starts at x0 = 0 with a positive initial velocity. The unforced motion of the system follows equation 14.20 and is shown by the green dashed curve.",0.0,-4.7987385
What is the formula for this rule?,"375 12.5 Kepler’s Laws and Planetary Motion Example 12.4 ​ Black Hole in the Center of the Milky Way Problem There is a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way. What is its mass? Solution In June 2007, astronomers measured the mass of the center of the Milky Way. Seven stars orbiting near the galactic center had been tracked for 15 years, as shown in Figure 12.21. The periods and semimajor axes extracted by the astronomers are shown in Table 12.2. Using these data and Kepler’s Third Law (equation 12.21), we can calculate the mass of the galactic center. The resulting mass of the galactic center is shown in Table 12.2 for each set of star mea- surements. The average mass of the galactic center is 3.7 · 106 times the mass of the Sun. Thus, astronomers infer that there is a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, because no star is visible at that point. Discussion If there is a supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, you may ask yourself why isn’t Earth being pulled toward it? The answer is the same as the answer to the question of why the Earth does not fall into the Sun: The Earth orbits the Sun, and the Sun orbits the galactic center, a distance of 26,000 light-years away from the Solar System.

What is the formula for this rule?,"1 State-Space Search for Problem Solving 1 Search is the primary technique used in Computer Science and Operations Research for solving computation-intensive combinatorial optimization problems, typically those in the NP-hard class [35]. The goal of a search is to quickly find an optimal or near-optimal solution from a finite or infinite but countable set of solutions. The size of the solution space of an NP-hard problem is exponential in term of the problem size in the worst case. Even in an average case, a search algorithm typically explores an exponential number of solutions in order to find an optimal one. Due to their nature, search algorithms that find optimal solutions are referred to as exact algorithms, and algorithms that find near-optimal or ap- proximate solutions are called approximation algorithms. Exact algorithms are numerative by nature. The two well-known paradigms of exact search are dynamic programming [9] and branch-and-bound [86, 112, 58]. This book is a study of the second paradigm, branch-and-bound. State-space search based on branch-and-bound (BnB) systematically and intelligently enumerates, explicitly or implicitly, the solutions of a problem. The enumeration is done using the principle of inclusion and exclusion [92, 125] and through successive solution-space partitioning. A partitioning of a solution space corresponds to a decomposition of the problem under consideration if there is no easy way to solve it directly.

We attempt to fix this by approximating 푓(푥) near 0 using a polynomial of higher degree: 푓(푥) ≈푃푛(푥) = 퐶0 + 퐶1푥+ 퐶2푥2 + ⋯+ 퐶푛−1푥푛−1 + 퐶푛푥푛.

In general, the higher the degree of a Taylor polynomial, the larger the interval on which the function and the polynomial remain close to each other. To see how to find the constants, let’s take 푛= 3 as an example: 푓(푥) ≈푃3(푥) = 퐶0 + 퐶1푥+ 퐶2푥2 + 퐶3푥3. Substituting 푥= 0 gives 푓(0) = 푃3(0) = 퐶0. Differentiating 푃3(푥) yields 푃′ 3(푥) = 퐶1 + 2퐶2푥+ 3퐶3푥2, so substituting 푥= 0 shows that 푓′(0) = 푃′ 3(0) = 퐶1.",0.0,-5.8651743

I’ve been making the same point for decades that the perceived laws of physics relate only to this reality, or what I would later call the simulation. When designers write codes to create computer and virtual reality games they are the equivalent of the laws of physics for that game. Players interact within the limitations laid out by the coding. In the same way those who wrote the codes for the simulation decided the laws of physics that would apply. These can be overridden by expanded states of consciousness, but not by those enslaved in only five-sense awareness where simulation codes rule. Overriding the codes is what people call ‘miracles’. They are not. They are bypassing the encoded limits of the simulation. A population caught in simulation perception would have no idea that this was their plight. As the Bonn paper said: ‘Like a prisoner in a pitch-black cell we would not be able to see the “walls” of our prison,’ That’s true if people remain mesmerised by the five senses. Open to expanded awareness and those walls become very clear. The main one is the speed of light. American theoretical physicist James Gates is another who has explored the simulation question and found considerable evidence to support the idea. Gates was Professor of Physics at the University of Maryland, Director of The Center for String and Particle Theory, and on Barack Obama’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. He and his team found computer codes of digital data embedded in the fabric of our reality. They relate to on-off electrical charges of 1 and 0 in the binary system used by computers. ‘We have no idea what they are doing there’, Gates said. They found within the energetic fabric mathematical sequences known as error- correcting codes or block codes that ‘reboot’ data to its original state or ‘default seĴings’ when something knocks it out of sync.

What is the formula for this rule?,"106 C H A P T E R 4 Economic Efficiency, Government Price Setting, and Taxes producer surplus on the first cup is $0.75 (shown by the area of rectangle A). Its pro- ducer surplus on the second cup is $0.50 (rectangle B). Its producer surplus on the third cup is $0.25 (rectangle C). Heavenly will not be willing to supply the fourth cup because the marginal cost of producing it is greater than the market price. Heavenly Tea’s total producer surplus is equal to $0.75 1 $0.50 1 $0.25 5 $1.50 (or the sum of rectangles A, B, and C). A higher price will increase producer surplus. For example, if the market price of chai tea rises from $2.00 to $2.25, Heavenly Tea’s producer surplus will increase from $1.50 to $2.25. (Make sure you understand how the new level of producer surplus was calculated.) The supply curve shown in panel (a) of Figure 4.4 does not look like the smooth curves we saw in Chapter 3 because this example uses a single firm producing only a small quantity of tea. With many firms, the market supply curve for chai tea will have the normal smooth shape shown in panel (b) of Figure 4.4. In panel (b), the quantity supplied at a price of $2.00 is 15,000 cups per day. We can calculate total producer sur- plus in panel (b) the same way we did in panel (a): by adding up the producer surplus received on each cup sold. Therefore, the total amount of producer surplus in a market is equal to the area above the market supply curve and below the market price. The total producer surplus tea sellers receive from selling chai tea is shown as the red area in panel (b) of Figure 4.4. What Consumer Surplus and Producer Surplus Measure We have seen that consumer surplus measures the benefit to consumers from participating in a market, and producer surplus measures the benefit to producers from participating in a market. It is important, however, to be clear about what this means. In a sense, consumer surplus measures the net benefit to consumers from participating in a market rather than the total benefit. That is, if the price of a product were zero, the consumer surplus in a market would be all of the area under the demand curve. When the price is not zero, consumer surplus is the area below the demand curve and above Price (dollars per cup) Quantity (cups per week) Market price 2.00 B Producer surplus on the second cup C Producer surplus on the third cup A Producer surplus on the first cup 1.50 1.75 0 1.25 Heavenly Tea’s supply curve $2.25 (a) Producer surplus for Heavenly Tea 1 2 3 4 0 Price (dollars per cup) Quantity (cups per week) 15,000 $2.00 Supply",0.0,-3.5700107

What is the formula for this rule?,"ρ = lim n →∞| xn + 1 (n + 1)! xn n! | = lim n →∞| xn + 1 (n + 1)! · n! xn| = lim n →∞| xn + 1 (n + 1) · n! · n! xn| = lim n →∞| x n + 1| = |x| lim n →∞ 1 n + 1 = 0 < 1 for all values of x. Therefore, the series converges for all real numbers x. The interval of convergence is (−∞, ∞) and the radius of convergence is R = ∞. b. Apply the ratio test. For x ≠0, we see that ρ = lim n →∞| (n + 1)!xn + 1 n!xn | = lim n →∞|(n + 1)x| = |x| lim n →∞(n + 1) = ∞. Therefore, the series diverges for all x ≠0. Since the series is centered at x = 0, it must converge there, so the series converges only for x ≠0. The interval of convergence is the single value x = 0 and the radius of convergence is R = 0. c. In order to apply the ratio test, consider ρ = lim n →∞| (x −2)n + 1 (n + 2)3n + 1 (x −2)n (n + 1)3n | = lim n →∞| (x −2)n + 1 (n + 2)3n + 1 · (n + 1)3n (x −2)n | = lim n →∞| (x −2)(n + 1) 3(n + 2) | = |x −2| 3 . The ratio ρ < 1 if |x −2| < 3. Since |x −2| < 3 implies that −3 < x −2 < 3, the series converges absolutely if −1 < x < 5. The ratio ρ > 1 if |x −2| > 3. Therefore, the series diverges if x < −1 or x > 5. The ratio test is inconclusive if ρ = 1. The ratio ρ = 1 if and only if x = −1 or x = 5. We need to test these values of x separately. For x = −1, the series is given by ∑ n = 0 ∞ (−1)n n + 1 = 1 −1 2 + 1 3 −1 4 + ⋯. 538 Chapter 6 | Power Series This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11965/1.2",1.0,2.6322792

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 18?,"Let A be a set. The identity function on A is the function ιA : A →A, where ιA(x) = x for all x ∈A. In other words, the identity function ιA is the function that assigns each element to itself. The function ιA is one-to-one and onto, so it is a bijection. (Note that ιis the Greek letter iota.) ◂ For future reference, we summarize what needs be to shown to establish whether a function is one-to-one and whether it is onto. It is instructive to review Examples 8–17 in light of this summary. Suppose that f : A →B. To show that f is injective Show that if f(x) = f(y) for arbitrary x, y ∈A, then x = y. To show that f is not injective Find particular elements x, y ∈A such that x ≠y and f(x) = f(y). To show that f is surjective Consider an arbitrary element y ∈B and find an element x ∈A such that f(x) = y. To show that f is not surjective Find a particular y ∈B such that f(x) ≠y for all x ∈A. 2.3.3 Inverse Functions and Compositions of Functions Now consider a one-to-one correspondence f from the set A to the set B. Because f is an onto function, every element of B is the image of some element in A. Furthermore, because f is also a one-to-one function, every element of B is the image of a unique element of A. Consequently, we can define a new function from B to A that reverses the correspondence given by f. This leads to Definition 9. Definition 9 Let f be a one-to-one correspondence from the set A to the set B. The inverse function of f is the function that assigns to an element b belonging to B the unique element a in A such that f(a) = b. The inverse function of f is denoted by f −1.

"What is the formula for 9.19 For each ionic compound formula,​?","’s $56 billion in wealth is likely to be in cur- rency or checking accounts. Most of his wealth is invested in stocks and bonds and other financial assets that are not included in the definition of money. In everyday conversation, we often describe someone who is wealthy or who has a high income as “having a lot of money.” But when economists use the word money, they are usually referring to currency plus checking account de- posits. It is important to keep straight the differences be- tween wealth, income, and money. Just as money and income are not the same for a per- son, they are not the same for the whole economy. National income in the United States was equal to $12.8 trillion in 2010. The money supply in 2010 was $1.8 trillion (using the M1 measure). There is no reason national income in a country should be equal to the country’s money supply, nor will an increase in a country’s money supply necessar- ily increase the country’s national income.

Find an expression for C. What is the best bound, that is, the smallest value of C that works? (Note: An important characteristic of chaotic systems is exponential sensitivity to initial conditions; the difference in position of two such systems with slightly different initial conditions grows exponentially with time. You have just shown that an oscillator in simple harmonic motion is not a chaotic system.)

If g varies by 0.16% over the various locations where it is sampled, what is the corresponding variation in the period of the pendulum? Assume that the length of the pendulum does not change from one site to another. •14.37 ​ A 1.00-kg mass is connected to a 2.00-kg mass by a massless rod 30.0 cm long, as shown in the figure. A hole is then drilled in the rod 10.0 cm away from the 1.00-kg mass, and the rod and masses are free to rotate about this pivot point, P. Calculate the period of oscillation for the masses if they are displaced slightly from the stable equilibrium position. •14.38 ​ A torsional pendulum is a vertically suspended wire with a mass attached to one end that is free to rotate. The wire resists twisting as well as elongation and compression, so it is subject to a rotational equivalent of Hooke’s Law:  = –. Use this information to find the frequency of a torsional pendulum. •14.39 ​ A physical pendulum consists of a uniform rod of mass M and length L.

With time, this fast, reversible step reaches equilibrium, as product changes to reactant as fast as it forms. As you’ll see, this situation allows us to fit the mechanism to the overall rate law. Consider once again the oxidation of nitrogen monoxide: 2NO(g) 1 O2(g) - £ 2NO2(g) The observed rate law is Rate 5 k3NO423O24 and a proposed mechanism is (1) NO(g) 1 O2(g) B A NO3(g) ​ ​ ​ [fast, reversible] (2) NO3(g) 1 NO(g) - £ 2NO2(g) ​ ​ ​ ​ [slow; rate determining] Let’s go through the three criteria to see if this mechanism is valid. With cancellation of the reaction intermediate, NO3, the sum of the steps gives the overall equation, so the first criterion is met: NO(g) 1 O2(g) 1 NO3(g) 1 NO(g) - £ NO3(g) 1 2NO2(g) or 2NO(g) 1 O2(g) - £ 2NO2(g) Both steps are bimolecular, so the second criterion is met. To see whether the third criterion—that the mechanism is consistent with the observed rate law—is met, we first write rate laws for the elementary steps: (1) Rate1(fwd) 5 k13NO4 3O24 Rate1(rev) 5 k213NO34 where k21 is the rate constant and NO3 is the reactant for the reverse reaction. (2) Rate2 5 k23NO34 3NO4 Next, we show that the rate law for the rate-determining step (step 2) gives the overall rate law. As written, it does not, because it contains the intermediate NO3, and an overall rate law includes only reactants (and products). We eliminate [NO3] from the rate law for step 2 by expressing it in terms of reactants, as follows. Step 1 reaches equilibrium when the forward and reverse rates are equal: Rate1( fwd) 5 Rate1( rev) or k13NO4 3O24 5 k213NO34",1.0,-0.683776

What is the formula for 2 R = 20.8 J/(mol K) for a diatomic gas.?,"4 C H A P T E R 1 Economics: Foundations and Models I n this book, we use economics to answer questions such as the following: • How are the prices of goods and services determined? • How does pollution affect the economy, and how should government policy deal with these effects? • Why do firms engage in international trade, and how do government policies af- fect international trade? • Why does government control the prices of some goods and services, and what are the effects of those controls? Economists do not always agree on the answers to every question. In fact, as we will see, economists engage in lively debate on some issues. In addition, new problems and issues are constantly arising. So, economists are always at work developing new methods to analyze economic questions. All the issues we discuss in this book illustrate a basic fact of life: People must make choices as they try to attain their goals. We must make choices because we live in a world of scarcity, which means that although our wants are unlimited, the resources available to fulfill those wants are limited. You might like to own a BMW and spend each sum- mer in five-star European hotels, but unless Bill Gates is a close and generous relative, you probably lack the money to fulfill these dreams. Every day, you make choices as you spend your limited income on the many goods and services available. The finite amount of time you have also limits your ability to attain your goals. If you spend an hour study- ing for your economics midterm, you have one hour less to study for your history mid- term. Firms and the government are in the same situation as you: They also must attain their goals with limited resources. Economics is the study of the choices consumers, business managers, and government officials make to attain their goals, given their scarce resources. We begin this chapter by discussing three important economic ideas that we will return to many times in this book: People are rational, people respond to incentives, and optimal decisions are made at the margin. Then we consider the three fundamental questions that any economy must answer: What goods and services will be produced? How will the goods and services be produced? and Who will receive the goods and services produced? Next, we consider the role of economic models in analyzing economic issues. Economic models are simplified versions of reality used to analyze real-world economic situations. We will explore why economists use models and how they construct them. Finally, we will discuss the differ- ence between microeconomics and macroeconomics, and we will preview some important economic terms. Three Key Economic Ideas As you try to achieve your goals, whether they involve buying a new computer or find- ing a part-time job, you will interact with other people in markets. A market is a group of buyers and sellers of a good or service and the institution or arrangement by which they come together to trade. Most of economics involves analyzing what happens in markets. Throughout this book, as we study how people make choices and interact in markets, we will return to three important ideas:",0.0,-8.811389
What is the formula for 2.3 EXERCISES?,"Facebook, Google, Amazon and their like were seed-funded and supported into existence with money-no-object infusions of funds either directly or indirectly from DARPA and CIA technology arm In-Q-Tel. The Cult plays the long game and prepares very carefully for big plays like ‘Covid’. Amazon is another front in the psychological war and preĴy much controls the global market in book sales and increasingly publishing.

Moves in that direction are already happening. Amazon’s leading light Jeff Bezos is the grandson of Lawrence Preston Gise who worked with DARPA predecessor ARPA. Amazon has big connections to the CIA and the Pentagon. The plan I have long described went like this: 1. Employ military technology to establish the Internet. 2. Sell the Internet as a place where people can freely communicate without censorship and allow that to happen until the Net becomes the central and irreversible pillar of human society. If the Internet had been highly censored from the start many would have rejected it. 3. Fund and manipulate major corporations into being to control the circulation of information on your Internet using cover stories about geeks in garages to explain how they came about. Give them unlimited funds to expand rapidly with no need to make a profit for years while non-Cult companies who need to balance the books cannot compete. You know that in these circumstances your Googles, YouTubes, Facebooks and Amazons are going to secure near monopolies by either crushing or buying up the opposition. 4. Allow freedom of expression on both the Internet and communication platforms to draw people in until the Internet is the central and irreversible pillar of human society and your communication corporations have reached a stage of near monopoly domination. 5. Then unleash your always-planned frenzy of censorship on the basis of ‘where else are you going to go?’ and continue to expand that until nothing remains that the Cult does not want its human targets to see.

The Spartans, returning from the water to their old camp by the temple of Héraklés, found themselves at close quarters with the enemy already drawn up for battle and advancing from the hill. This caused them greater alarm than any other occasion on record. There was little time for preparation, and they formed ranks in haste, under the orders of Agis. For it is their rule that when a king is in command all orders are given by him. He instructs the polemarkhoi, they give the word to the lokhagoi, they to the pentekoniéres, they in turn to the endmotia. All necessary orders are passed on through the same channels and quickly reach the ranks. Por almost the whole Spartan army with a few exceptions consists of officers serving under officers and responsibility for seeing that orders are carried out is widely delegated . . ./ Thucydides now describes the formation and estimates sizes. | (69) Before they actually engaged, the generals on either side spoke a few words ef encouragement... The Spartans meanwhile sang war-songs and exchanged words of individual encouragement, reminding each other of their proven courage and well aware that long training in action is more effective than a few words of encouragement, however well delivered. (70) After this they joined battle. the Argives and their allies advancing with vigour and fury, the Spartans slowly to the sound of pipes, a standing institution in their army, not for religious reasons but to make them advance evenly, keeping time, without breaking ranks as large armies are apt to do at the moment of impact. (71) As they were approaching each other, Agis decided on the following manoeuvre. All armies have a common tendency as they go into action; they get pushed out towards the right. and overlap the enemy left with their own right wing, because each man seeks protection for his own uncovered right-hand side from the shield of his nght-hand neighbour, thinking that the more closely the shields are locked the safer he will be. The man primarily responsible is the man on the extreme right of the front line, who keeps trying to keep his own unarmed side away from the enemy; the rest follow him with the same motive. On the present occasion the Mantineians far outhlanked the Skiritai, and the Spartans and Tegeans outflanked the Athenians still further, their force being correspondingly larger. Agis was afraid that his left would be surrounded, and that the Mantinelans were outflanking it too far; he therefore ordered the Skiritai and the Brasideioi to move out of their position in the line and level up the front with the Mantineians, while he passed word to the two generals Hipponotdas and Aristokles to move two companies from the right wing to fill the gap, thinking he had men to spare on his right and that he would strengthen the line facing the Mantineians.

What is the formula for CONCLUSIONS?,"While the political economy of the mass media was closely related to leveraging audiences for power based on ideological conformity, the political economy of digital media is critically different. The digital media giants are creators and aggregators of big data systems that monitor and assess us continually to create a new kind of power. Big data systems greatly intensify the extent and frequency of how we are monitored in everyday life and at the societal level shift the governmental logic from surveillance and discipline to capture and control (Deleuze, 1992). That is, there is a shift from Foucault's (19?5} notion of disciplinary technologies to Deleuze's (1992) concept of technologies of control. Foucault's notion of discipline as a mode of power had the idea Of discipline as a 'machine' that works on a societal scale {Foucault, 1975). The four mechanisms of this 'machine' are: individuals being distributed in space; activity in space being regulated; the organisation Of geneses - a series of techniques being used to organise the training of individuals; and the composition of forces where the organisation of each technique is to produce the product of an individual subject lsavat, 2012: 16). In this view, the bureaucracies and rules of everyday life have conditioned us to behave, in the big data world, there is nobody watching us - but that does not make us free, Instead, everything we do that intersects with digital media is measured and stored and used to nudge us towards outcomes decided by commercial relationships. The power of digital media comes from the ability to harvest, process and use us in this manner. From those processes, immense political, social and cultural power is in the hands of just a few companies - as well as wealth beyond the comprehension of most of us for the owners of these companies, The model has changed, and this change is important The power of Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and others is of a different nature, The use of unpaid labour and the control of the media consumer is still there - and is far more problematic than ever before.

Solution: S ◦R is constructed using all ordered pairs in R and ordered pairs in S, where the second element of the ordered pair in R agrees with the first element of the ordered pair in S. For example, the ordered pairs (2, 3) in R and (3, 1) in S produce the ordered pair (2, 1) in S ◦R. Computing all the ordered pairs in the composite, we find S ◦R = {(1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 0), (3, 1)}. Figure 3 illustrates how this composition is found.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Find all solutions of the recurrence relation an = 3an−1 + 2n. What is the solution with a1 = 3? Solution: To solve this linear nonhomogeneous recurrence relation with constant coefficients, we need to solve its associated linear homogeneous equation and to find a particular solution for the given nonhomogeneous equation. The associated linear homogeneous equation is an = 3an−1. Its solutions are a(h) n = α3n, where αis a constant. We now find a particular solution. Because F(n) = 2n is a polynomial in n of degree one, a reasonable trial solution is a linear function in n, say, pn = cn + d, where c and d are constants. To determine whether there are any solutions of this form, suppose that pn = cn + d is such a solution. Then the equation an = 3an−1 + 2n becomes cn + d = 3(c(n −1) + d) + 2n. Sim- plifying and combining like terms gives (2 + 2c)n + (2d −3c) = 0. It follows that cn + d is a solution if and only if 2 + 2c = 0 and 2d −3c = 0. This shows that cn + d is a solution if and only if c = −1 and d = −3∕2. Consequently, a(p) n = −n −3∕2 is a particular solution. By Theorem 5 all solutions are of the form an = a(p) n + a(h) n = −n −3 2 + α⋅3n, where αis a constant. To find the solution with a1 = 3, let n = 1 in the formula we obtained for the general so- lution. We find that 3 = −1 −3∕2 + 3α, which implies that α= 11∕6. The solution we seek is an = −n −3∕2 + (11∕6)3n. ◂",0.0,-0.5969622

What is the formula for S-41?,"ai+1 −ai. Be- cause gcd(q, 2s) = 1 and for sufficiently large i both q and 2s divide ai+1 −ai, k = 2sq divides ai+1 −ai for sufficiently large i. Hence, for sufficiently large i, ai+1 −ai ≡0 (mod k). This means that the sequence is eventually constant modulo k. Finally, suppose k is odd. Then gcd(2, k) = 1, so by Euler’s theorem (found in elementary number theory books, such as [Ro10]), we know that 2φ(k) ≡1 (mod k). Let r = φ(k). Be- cause r < k, by the inductive hypothesis T(r), the sequence a1, a2, a3, ... is eventually constant modulo r, say equal to c. Hence, for large enough i, for some integer ti, ai = tir + c. Hence, ai+1 = 2ai = 2tir+c = (2r)ti2c ≡2c (mod k). This shows that a1, a2, ... is eventually constant modulo k. 45. a) 92 b) 91 c) 91 d) 91 e) 91 f) 91 47. The basis step is incorrect because n ≠1 for the sum shown. 49. Let P(n) be “the plane is divided into n2−n+2 regions by n circles if every two of these circles have two common points but no three have a common point.” Basis step: P(1) is true because a circle di- vides the plane into 2 = 12 −1+2 regions. Inductive step: As- sume that P(k) is true, that is, k circles with the specified prop- erties divide the plane into k2 −k + 2 regions. Suppose that a (k+1)st circle is added. This circle intersects each of the other k circles in two points, so these points of intersection form 2k new arcs, each of which splits an old region. Hence, there are 2k regions split, which shows that there are 2k more regions than there were previously. Hence, k + 1 circles satisfying the specified properties divide the plane into k2−k+2+2k = (k2+ 2k+1)−(k+1)+2 = (k+1)2−(k+1)+2 regions. 51. Suppose √ 2 were rational. Then √ 2 = a∕b, where a and b are positive integers. It follows that the set S = {n √ 2 ∣n ∈N} ∩N is a nonempty set of positive integers, because b √ 2 = a belongs to S. Let t be the least element of S, which exists by the well- ordering property. Then t = s √ 2 for some integer s. We have t −s = s √ 2 −s = s( √ 2 −1), so t −s is a positive integer because √ 2 > 1. Hence, t −s belongs to S. This is a contra- diction because t −s = s √ 2 −s < s. Hence, √ 2 is irrational.",1.0,-0.804658

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 13?,"Prove the theorem “If n is an integer, then n is odd if and only if n2 is odd.” Solution: This theorem has the form “p if and only if q,” where p is “n is odd” and q is “n2 is odd.” (As usual, we do not explicitly deal with the universal quantification.) To prove this theorem, we need to show that p →q and q →p are true. We have already shown (in Example 1) that p →q is true and (in Example 8) that q →p is Extra Examples true. Because we have shown that both p →q and q →p are true, we have shown that the theorem is true. ◂ Sometimes a theorem states that several propositions are equivalent. Such a theorem states that propositions p1, p2, p3, ... , pn are equivalent. This can be written as p1 ↔p2 ↔⋯↔pn, which states that all n propositions have the same truth values, and consequently, that for all i and j with 1 ≤i ≤n and 1 ≤j ≤n, pi and pj are equivalent. One way to prove these are mutually equivalent is to use the tautology p1 ↔p2 ↔⋯↔pn ↔(p1 →p2) ∧(p2 →p3) ∧⋯∧(pn →p1). This shows that if the n conditional statements p1 →p2, p2 →p3, ... , pn →p1 can be shown to be true, then the propositions p1, p2, ... , pn are all equivalent. This is much more efficient than proving that pi →pj for all i ≠j with 1 ≤i ≤n and 1 ≤ j ≤n. (Note that there are n2 −n such conditional statements.) When we prove that a group of statements are equivalent, we can establish any chain of conditional statements we choose as long as it is possible to work through the chain to go from any one of these statements to any other statement. For example, we can show that p1, p2, and p3 are equivalent by showing that p1 →p3, p3 →p2, and p2 →p1.",1.0,2.3577316

Mathematical Models A large variety of real-world situations can be described using mathematical models. A mathematical model is a method of simulating real-life situations with mathematical equations. Physicists, engineers, economists, and other researchers develop models by combining observation with quantitative data to develop equations, functions, graphs, and other mathematical tools to describe the behavior of various systems accurately. Models are useful because they help predict future outcomes. Examples of mathematical models include the study of population dynamics, investigations of weather patterns, and predictions of product sales. As an example, let’s consider a mathematical model that a company could use to describe its revenue for the sale of a particular item. The amount of revenue R a company receives for the sale of n items sold at a price of p dollars per item is described by the equation R = p · n. The company is interested in how the sales change as the price of the item changes. Suppose the data in Table 1.6 show the number of units a company sells as a function of the price per item. 44 Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",0.0,-1.5753682

What is the formula for THE CULTURE INDUSTRY?,"Wow ... The reality that humanity thinks is so real is an illusion. Politicians, governments, scientists, doctors, academics, law enforcement, media, school and university curriculums, on and on, are all founded on a world that does not exist except as a simulated prison cell. Is it such a stretch to accept that ‘Covid’ doesn’t exist when our entire ‘physical’ reality doesn’t exist? Revealed here is the knowledge kept under raps in the Cult networks of compartmentalised secrecy to control humanity’s sense of reality by inducing the population to believe in a reality that’s not real. If it wasn’t so tragic in its experiential consequences the whole thing would be hysterically funny. None of this is new to Renegade Minds. Ancient Greek philosopher Plato (about 428 to about 347BC) was a major influence on Gnostic belief and he described the human plight thousands of years ago with his Allegory of the Cave. He told the symbolic story of prisoners living in a cave who had never been outside. They were chained and could only see one wall of the cave while behind them was a fire that they could not see. Figures walked past the fire casting shadows on the prisoners’ wall and those moving shadows became their sense of reality. Some prisoners began to study the shadows and were considered experts on them (today’s academics and scientists), but what they studied was only an illusion (today’s academics and scientists). A prisoner escaped from the cave and saw reality as it really is. When he returned to report this revelation they didn’t believe him, called him mad and threatened to kill him if he tried to set them free. Plato’s tale is not only a brilliant analogy of the human plight and our illusory reality. It describes, too, the dynamics of the ‘Covid’ hoax. I have only skimmed the surface of these subjects here. The aim of this book is to crisply connect all essential dots to put what is happening today into its true context. All subject areas and their connections in this chapter are covered in great evidential detail in Everything You Need To Know, But Have Never Been Told and The Answer.

The rabbit population can be modeled using a recurrence relation. At the end of the first month, the number of pairs of rabbits on the island is f1 = 1. Because this pair does not breed during the second month, f2 = 1 also. To find the number of pairs after n months, add The Fibonacci numbers appear in many other places in nature, including the number of petals on flowers and the number of spirals on seedheads. the number on the island the previous month, fn−1, and the number of newborn pairs, which equals fn−2, because each newborn pair comes from a pair at least 2 months old. Consequently, the sequence {fn} satisfies the recurrence relation fn = fn−1 + fn−2 for n ≥3 together with the initial conditions f1 = 1 and f2 = 1. Because this recurrence relation and the initial conditions uniquely determine this sequence, the number of pairs of rabbits on the island after n months is given by the nth Fibonacci number. ◂ Example 2 involves a famous puzzle.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Theorem of Pappus This section ends with a discussion of the theorem of Pappus for volume, which allows us to find the volume of particular kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of Pappus for surface area, but it is much less useful than the theorem for volume.) Theorem 6.14: Theorem of Pappus for Volume Let R be a region in the plane and let l be a line in the plane that does not intersect R. Then the volume of the solid of revolution formed by revolving R around l is equal to the area of R multiplied by the distance d traveled by the centroid of R. Proof We can prove the case when the region is bounded above by the graph of a function f(x) and below by the graph of a function g(x) over an interval ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦, and for which the axis of revolution is the y-axis. In this case, the area of the region is A = ∫ a b ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx. Since the axis of rotation is the y-axis, the distance traveled by the centroid of the region depends only on the x-coordinate of the centroid, x – , which is x – = My m , where m = ρ∫ a b ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx and My = ρ∫ a b x ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx. Then, d = 2π ρ∫ a b x ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx ρ∫ a b ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx and thus d · A = 2π∫ a b x ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx. However, using the method of cylindrical shells, we have V = 2π∫ a b x ⎡ ⎣f(x) −g(x) ⎤ ⎦dx. So, V = d · A and the proof is complete. □ Example 6.34 Using the Theorem of Pappus for Volume Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration 721",1.0,-1.9376321

What is the formula for this rule?,"As we saw in Chapter 18, an adiabatic process is one in which the state of a system changes and no exchange of heat with the surroundings takes place during the change. An adiabatic process can occur when the system change occurs quickly. Thus, Q = 0 for an adiabatic process. From the First Law of Thermodynamics, we then have Eint = –W, as shown in Chapter 18. Let’s explore how the change in volume is related to the change in pressure for an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic process, that is, a process in the absence of heat transfer. The relationship is given by pV =constant (for an adiabatic process), (19.25) where  = Cp/CV is the ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure and the specific heat at constant volume for the ideal gas. Concept Check 19.6 The ratio of specific heat at constant pressure to specific heat at constant volume, Cp/CV, for an ideal gas a) is always equal to 1. b) is always smaller than 1. c) is always larger than 1. d) can be smaller or larger than 1, depending on the degrees of freedom of the gas molecules. Derivation 19.3 Pressure and Volume in an Adiabatic Process In order to derive the relationship between pressure and volume for an adiabatic process, let’s consider small differential changes in the internal energy during such a process: dEint = –dW. In Chapter 18, we saw that dW = p dV, and therefore for the adiabatic process, we have dE pdV = – . int (i) However, equation 19.21 says that the internal energy is related in general to the temperature: Eint = nCVT.

Solutions with higher costs can be produced with less computation by using a larger value of e. Solutions with lower costs can be produced with greater computation by using a smaller value of e. Figure 7.4 shows examples of this tradeoff for e-DFBnB with actual-value ordering on uniform random trees T(b = 2, d = 10) and T(b = 2, d = 20) (Figure 7.4(a)), and T(b = 4, d = 10) and T(b = 4, d = 20) (Figure 7.4(b)). The edge costs are uniformly chosen from the set {O, l/r, 2/r,· .. , 1- l/r}, where r = 216 - 1. The horizontal axes represent the average number of nodes expanded by e-DFBnB, as a percentage of the average number of nodes expanded by pure depth-first branch-and-bound, for finding an opti- mal goal node. The vertical axes represent the average relative error of the actual cost of the goal nodes found by e-DFBnB, as a percentage of the optimal goal cost. Data points in Figure 7.4, each of which is averaged over 500 trials, correspond to different values of e, with e = 0.0 for the rightmost point, e = 0.1 for the next data point to the left and so on, up to e = 1.0 for the leftmost point. c-DFBnB with c = 0.0 is exactly pure depth-first branch-and-bound. c-DFBnB with e = 1 and node ordering corresponds to a greedy algorithm, which starts at the root, and repeatedly expands a child node that has minimum cost among all children of the current node until it reaches a leaf node. Figure 7.4 also shows that for two trees with the same branching factor, this tradeoff is more pronounced on a deep tree than on a shallow one. When e < c*, e-BnB expands an exponential number of nodes O({3d), where {3 is a constant greater than one. However, {3 depends on c, and a larger e gives a smaller (3. That is, el gives rise to expected complexity O({3f) and e2 gives rise to expected complexity O({3~), and {31 > {32 if el < e2.",0.0,-1.1712109
What is the formula for 20.12 Expressing the free energy change when Q is at standard?,"Protein Interaction Graphs A protein interaction in a living cell occurs when two or more proteins in that cell bind to perform a biological function. Because protein interactions are cru- Links cial for most biological functions, many scientists work on discovering new proteins and under- standing interactions between proteins. Protein interactions within a cell can be modeled using a protein interaction graph (also called a protein–protein interaction network), an undirected graph in which each protein is represented by a vertex, with an edge connecting the vertices rep- resenting each pair of proteins that interact. It is a challenging problem to determine genuine protein interactions in a cell, as experiments often produce false positives, which conclude that two proteins interact when they really do not. Protein interaction graphs can be used to deduce important biological information, such as by identifying the most important proteins for various functions and the functionality of newly discovered proteins. Because there are thousands of different proteins in a typical cell, the protein interaction graph of a cell is extremely large and complex. For example, yeast cells have more than 6,000 proteins, and more than 80,000 interactions between them are known, and human cells have more than 100,000 proteins, with perhaps as many as 1,000,000 interactions between them. Additional vertices and edges are added to a protein interaction graph when new proteins and interactions between proteins are discovered. Because of the complexity of protein interac- tion graphs, they are often split into smaller graphs called modules that represent groups of proteins that are involved in a particular function of a cell. Figure 12 illustrates a module of the protein interaction graph described in [Bo04], comprising the complex of proteins that de- grade RNA in human cells. To learn more about protein interaction graphs, see [Bo04], [Ne10], and [Hu07]. ◂ Semantic Networks Graph models are used extensively in natural language understanding and in information retrieval.

State the THEOREM 2.,"143 5.4 Work Done by a Constant Force Figure 5.11 shows the initial and final positions of the pallet of bricks and the ropes and pulleys used to lift it. Lifting it without mechanical aids would require the force T2, as indicated, whose magnitude is given by T2 = mg. The work done by force T2 in this case is W2 = i T r 2 2 = T2r2 = mgr2. Pulling on the rope with force T 1 of magnitude T1 = 1 2 T2 = 1 2 mg accomplishes the same thing. However, the displacement is then twice as long, r1 = 2r2, as you can see by examining Figure 5.11. Thus, the work done in this case is W1 = i T r 1 1 = ( 1 2 T2)(2r2)= mgr2 = W2. The same amount of work is done in both cases. It is necessary to compensate for the reduced force by pulling the rope through a longer distance. This result is general for the use of pulleys or lever arms or any other mechanical force multiplier: The total work done is the same as it would be if the mechanical aid were not used. Any reduction in the force is always going to be compensated for by a proportional lengthening of the displacement. We end this section with a solved problem, which we solve with kinetic energy con- cepts of Section 5.2. As a double-check step we use the concepts of work for a constant force, which we developed in the present section, showing that both paths lead to the same answer.

What is the formula for 1.6 Rules of Inference?,"M uch of discrete mathematics is devoted to the study of discrete structures, used to rep- resent discrete objects. Many important discrete structures are built using sets, which are collections of objects. Among the discrete structures built from sets are combinations, un- ordered collections of objects used extensively in counting; relations, sets of ordered pairs that represent relationships between objects; graphs, sets of vertices and edges that connect vertices; and finite state machines, used to model computing machines. These are some of the topics we will study in later chapters. The concept of a function is extremely important in discrete mathematics. A function as- signs to each element of a first set exactly one element of a second set, where the two sets are not necessarily distinct. Functions play important roles throughout discrete mathematics. They are used to represent the computational complexity of algorithms, to study the size of sets, to count objects, and in a myriad of other ways. Useful structures such as sequences and strings are special types of functions. In this chapter, we will introduce the notion of sequences, which represent ordered lists of elements. Furthermore, we will introduce some important types of sequences and we will show how to define the terms of a sequence using earlier terms. We will also address the problem of identifying a sequence from its first few terms. In our study of discrete mathematics, we will often add consecutive terms of a sequence of numbers. Because adding terms from a sequence, as well as other indexed sets of numbers, is such a common occurrence, a special notation has been developed for adding such terms. In this chapter, we will introduce the notation used to express summations. We will develop formulae for certain types of summations that appear throughout the study of discrete mathematics. For instance, we will encounter such summations in the analysis of the number of steps used by an algorithm to sort a list of numbers so that its terms are in increasing order. The relative sizes of infinite sets can be studied by introducing the notion of the size, or cardinality, of a set. We say that a set is countable when it is finite or has the same size as the set of positive integers. In this chapter we will establish the surprising result that the set of rational numbers is countable, while the set of real numbers is not. We will also show how the concepts we discuss can be used to show that there are functions that cannot be computed using a computer program in any programming language. Matrices are used in discrete mathematics to represent a variety of discrete structures. We will review the basic material about matrices and matrix arithmetic needed to represent relations and graphs. The matrix arithmetic we study will be used to solve a variety of problems involving these structures. 2.1 Sets 2.1.1 Introduction In this section, we study the fundamental discrete structure on which all other discrete structures are built, namely, the set. Sets are used to group objects together. Often, but not always, the objects in a set have similar properties. For instance, all the students who are currently enrolled in your school make up a set. Likewise, all the students currently taking a course in discrete mathematics at any school make up a set. In addition, those students enrolled in your school who are taking a course in discrete mathematics form a set that can be obtained by taking the elements common to the first two collections. The language of sets is a means to study such 121",0.0,-6.324258

Because free energy (G) combines three state functions, H, S, and T, it is also a state function. As we do with enthalpy, we focus on the free energy change (DG ).

Sulon et al, (20181 rdenhlied that Facebook is far from meaningless to Gen Z and younger people, For these groups, the meaning of Facebook has changed. It as more akin to a personal service platform for coordinating events, archiving and relationship maintenance. Bille et al. (2015) argued that Facebook as more like an atmosphere, a force that attunes people to the world. The perceived presence of Facebook as ahlvays here in our world, even if we are not using it. As such, lt is a part of how we understand and comprehend the world. Online advertising has been seen as a mechanism by which Meta exploits users as users become a commodity. Web 2.0 (the term given to participatory use of the Web and other applications on the lntemeti in general has been seen as based on the exploitation of free labour (Terranova, 2004), but Meta has perfemed this explortation. Under the conditions of use of the platform, most users become part of a creative precarious underclass of labourers whose 'work' is dictated by and tor the benefit of the platform that they use (Lovink, 2011). As Kylie Jarrett (2015 and 2022) argues, the immaterial labour that is used by social media is akin to a form of unpaid domestic labour - in effect we become 'a digital housewife'. This economy is dominated by a few corporate media companies that use the notion of 'sharing' for mystifying the logic of profit, advertising and commerce that is at the heart of their operation (John, 20131 - with Meta being an ideal example The philosopher of technology Evgeny Morozov crystallises these criticisms. Optimism around social media is based on the techno-deterministic ideologies of Cyber-utoplanlsm (Morozov, 2011). This view only sees advantages for businesses and society through the lens of that industry and the benefits to that industry without taking into account the realities of exploitation and the contradictions of capitalism, Jose van Duck (2013, 111 argues that social media achieves this through an automation of the social and social behaviours by englneenng and manipulating social connections. Douglas Rushkoft (2010: 158) argues that as a result of this, social media is involved in a process of ""optimizing humans for machinery' Christian Fuchs {2015: 15) summarises why this is so problematic. Meta is a company controlled by private shareholders who own Meta's platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Whatshppi. Meta's users create data whenever they are online that refers to their profiles and online behaviour, This data is sold to Meta's advertising clients who are enabled to present targeted advertisements on users' profiles. Without Meta users, there would be no profit. So, users create the monetary value and profit of Meta but they do not own this profit, which is controlled by Meta's shareholders. Meta users are exploited. Indeed, social media prosumers are double objems of oommodrfication: they are commodities themselves, and through this oommodrfication their consciousness (as embodied through their activity) becomes, while online, per""lanently exposed to commodity logic tn the fem of advertisements (Fuchs, 2015: 160).

What is the formula for this rule?,"Step 2: To find the y -intercept, evaluate f(0). Since f(0) = 1, the y -intercept is (0, 1). To find the x - intercept, solve (x −1)2/3 = 0. The solution of this equation is x = 1, so the x -intercept is (1, 0). Step 3: Since lim x →±∞(x −1)2/3 = ∞, the function continues to grow without bound as x →∞and x →−∞. Step 4: The function has no vertical asymptotes. Step 5: To determine where f is increasing or decreasing, calculate f′. We find f′(x) = 2 3(x −1)−1/3 = 2 3(x −1)1/3. This function is not zero anywhere, but it is undefined when x = 1. Therefore, the only critical point is x = 1. Divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, 1) and (1, ∞), and choose test points in each of these intervals to determine the sign of f′(x) in each of these smaller intervals. Let x = 0 and x = 2 be the test points as shown in the following table. Interval Test Point Sign of f′(x) = 2 3(x −1)1/3 Conclusion (−∞, 1) x = 0 +/ −= − f is decreasing. (1, ∞) x = 2 +/ + = + f is increasing. We conclude that f has a local minimum at x = 1. Evaluating f at x = 1, we find that the value of f at the local minimum is zero. Note that f′(1) is undefined, so to determine the behavior of the function at this critical point, we need to examine lim x →1f′(x). Looking at the one-sided limits, we have lim x →1+ 2 3(x −1)1/3 = ∞and lim x →1− 2 3(x −1)1/3 = −∞. Therefore, f has a cusp at x = 1. Step 6: To determine concavity, we calculate the second derivative of f: f′′(x) = −2 9(x −1)−4/3 = −2 9(x −1)4/3. We find that f′′(x) is defined for all x, but is undefined when x = 1. Therefore, divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, 1) and (1, ∞), and choose test points to evaluate the sign of f′′(x) in each of these intervals. As we did earlier, let x = 0 and x = 2 be test points as shown in the following table. Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 439",1.0,2.265948

What is the formula for this rule?,"early January when word broke that it would invest $450 million in Face- book. Even more intriguing, though, was the news that Goldman would create a fund through which its clients could buy some $1.5 billion worth of shares in the fast-growing, privately held social-networking company. But you don’t have to be a well- heeled Goldman client to get in on Facebook or other hot, privately held companies before they go public. Two Web sites—SharesPost.com and Sec- ondMarket.com—provide electronic platforms that allow qualified inves- tors to buy shares from company in- siders and employees who want to cash out before a company goes public. By offering a way to enter an area previously open only to Wall Street’s elite, “we democratize the opportunity to invest in private company stocks,” says David Weir, chief executive of SharesPost.

Courtesy of George Csicsery PAUL ERD ̋ OS (1913–1996) Paul Erd ̋ os, born in Budapest, Hungary, was the son of two high school mathe- Links matics teachers. He was a child prodigy; at age 3 he could multiply three-digit numbers in his head, and at 4 he discovered negative numbers on his own. Because his mother did not want to expose him to contagious diseases, he was mostly home-schooled. At 17 Erd ̋ os entered E ̋ otv ̋ os University, graduating four years later with a Ph.D. in mathematics. After graduating he spent four years at Manchester, England, on a postdoctoral fellowship. In 1938 he went to the United States because of the difficult political situation in Hungary, especially for Jews. He spent much of his time in the United States, except for 1954 to 1962, when he was banned as part of the paranoia of the McCarthy era. He also spent considerable time in Israel. Erd ̋ os made many significant contributions to combinatorics and to number theory. One of the discoveries of which he was most proud is his elementary proof (in the sense that it does not use any complex analysis) of the prime number theorem, which provides an estimate for the number of primes not exceeding a fixed positive integer. He also participated in the modern development of the Ramsey theory. Erd ̋ os traveled extensively throughout the world to work with other mathematicians, visiting conferences, universities, and research laboratories. He had no permanent home. He devoted himself almost entirely to mathematics, traveling from one mathe- matician to the next, proclaiming “My brain is open.” Erd ̋ os was the author or coauthor of more than 1500 papers and had more than 500 coauthors. Copies of his articles are kept by Ron Graham, a famous discrete mathematician with whom he collaborated extensively and who took care of many of his worldly needs. Erd ̋ os offered rewards, ranging from $10 to $10,000, for the solution of problems that he found particularly interesting, with the size of the reward depending on the difficulty of the problem. He paid out close to $4000. Erd ̋ os had his own special language, using such terms as “epsilon” (child), “boss” (woman), “slave” (man), “captured” (married), “liberated” (divorced), “Supreme Fascist” (God), “Sam” (United States), and “Joe” (Soviet Union). Although he was curious about many things, he concentrated almost all his energy on mathematical research. He had no hobbies and no full-time job. He never married and apparently remained celibate.",0.0,-5.4864197

What is the formula for 37.4 Finite Potential Wells?,"Let’s return to the one-dimensional case and solve a problem that is a bit more complicated than that of a potential well with infinitely high potential outside it. Here we consider the case where the wall of the well is not infinitely high, but instead has a finite height. The shape of the finite potential well we want to study is shown in Figure 37.10: The potential energy U(x) is zero inside the interval from 0 to a, is infinite for all values of x < 0, and has a finite constant value of U1 > 0 for x > a: U x x x a U ( )= ∞ for for fo < ≤≤ 0 0 0 1 r x a >            . Just as in the case of the infinite potential well, we construct a solution for each of the three regions separately and then match these solutions to each other at the boundaries. The solution remains the same as before for x < 0, where the wave function must have a constant value of zero. In the interval from 0 to a, the wave function again must have the general form (x) = C cos (x) + D sin (x). And again, because the wave function has to be continuous and (0) = 0, the coefficient C must be 0, giving the solution (x) = D sin (x) in the interval between 0 and a. For x > a, however, there are new effects.

What is the formula for this rule?,"into mouse foetuses with fully formed organs using artificial wombs in a development they say could pave the way for gestating humans outside the womb. Professor Jacob Hanna of the Weizmann Institute of Science said: We took mouse embryos from the mother at day five of development, when they are just of 250 cells, and had them in the incubator from day five until day 11, by which point they had grown all their organs. By day 11 they make their own blood and have a beating heart, a fully developed brain. Anybody would look at them and say, ‘this is clearly a mouse foetus with all the characteristics of a mouse.’ It’s gone from being a ball of cells to being an advanced foetus. A special liquid is used to nourish embryo cells in a laboratory dish and they float on the liquid to duplicate the first stage of embryonic development. The incubator creates all the right conditions for its development, Hanna said. The liquid gives the embryo ‘all the nutrients, hormones and sugars they need’ along with a custom-made electronic incubator which controls gas concentration, pressure and temperature. The cuĴing-edge in the underground bases and other secret locations will be light years ahead of that, however, and this was reported by the London Guardian in 2017: We are approaching a biotechnological breakthrough. Ectogenesis, the invention of a complete external womb, could completely change the nature of human reproduction. In April this year, researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia announced their development of an artificial womb. The article was headed ‘Artificial wombs could soon be a reality. What will this mean for women?’ What would it mean for children is an even bigger question. No mother to bond with only a machine in preparation for a life of soulless interaction and control in a world governed by machines (see the Matrix movies).

What is the formula for this rule?,"202 Chapter 4 USING THE DERIVATIVE The critical points divide the domain of 푓into intervals within which the sign of the derivative remains the same, either positive or negative. Therefore, if 푓is defined on the interval between two successive critical points, its graph cannot change direction on that interval; it is either increasing or decreasing. The following result, which is proved on page 206, tells us that all local maxima and minima which are not at endpoints occur at critical points. Theorem 4.1: Local Extrema and Critical Points Suppose 푓is defined on an interval and has a local maximum or minimum at the point 푥= 푎, which is not an endpoint of the interval. If 푓is differentiable at 푥= 푎, then 푓′(푎) = 0. Thus, 푎is a critical point. Warning! Not every critical point is a local maximum or local minimum. Consider 푓(푥) = 푥3, which has a critical point at 푥= 0. (See Figure 4.2.) The derivative, 푓′(푥) = 3푥2, is positive on both sides of 푥= 0, so 푓increases on both sides of 푥= 0, and there is neither a local maximum nor a local minimum at 푥= 0. 푥 푓(푥) = 푥3 Critical point ■ Figure 4.2: Critical point which is not a local maximum or minimum Testing for Local Maxima and Minima at a Critical Point If 푓′ has different signs on either side of a critical point 푝, with 푓′(푝) = 0, then the graph changes direction at 푝and looks like one of those in Figure 4.3. So we have the following criterion: The First-Derivative Test for Local Maxima and Minima Suppose 푝is a critical point of a continuous function 푓. Moving from left to right: • If 푓′ changes from negative to positive at 푝, then 푓has a local minimum at 푝. • If 푓′ changes from positive to negative at 푝, then 푓has a local maximum at 푝. 푝 Local min 푓′(푝) = 0 푓decreasing 푓′ < 0 푓increasing 푓′ > 0 푝 Local max 푓′(푝) = 0 푓increasing 푓′ > 0 푓decreasing 푓′ < 0 Figure 4.3: Changes in direction at a critical point, 푝: Local maxima and minima Example2 Use a graph of the function 푓(푥) = 1 푥(푥−1) to observe its local maxima and minima.

We must make choices because of scarcity, which means that although our wants are unlimited, the resources available to fulfill those wants are limited. Economists assume that people are rational in the sense that consumers and firms use all available information as they take actions intended to achieve their goals. Rational individuals weigh the benefits and costs of each action and choose an action only if the benefits outweigh the costs. Although people act from a variety of motives, ample evidence in- dicates that they respond to economic incentives. Economists use the word marginal to mean extra or additional. The optimal deci- sion is to continue any activity up to the point where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.

What is the formula for this rule?,"1.3 a. To find the zeros, solve x + 3 + 1 = 0. This equation implies x + 3 = −1. Since x + 3 ≥0 for all x, this equation has no solutions, and therefore f has no zeros. b. The y -intercept is given by ⎛ ⎝0, f(0) ⎞ ⎠= (0, 3 + 1). c. To graph this function, we make a table of values. Since we need x + 3 ≥0, we need to choose values of x ≥−3. We choose values that make the square-root function easy to evaluate. x −3 −2 1 f(x) 1 2 3 Table 1.2 Making use of the table and knowing that, since the function is a square root, the graph of f should be similar to the graph of y = x, we sketch the graph (Figure 1.10).

Example 1.5 Finding the Height of a Free-Falling Object If a ball is dropped from a height of 100 ft, its height s at time t is given by the function s(t) = −16t2 + 100, where s is measured in feet and t is measured in seconds. The domain is restricted to the interval [0, c], where t = 0 is the time when the ball is dropped and t = c is the time when the ball hits the ground. a. Create a table showing the height s(t) when t = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5. Using the data from the table, determine the domain for this function.

There were three harbours. Kantharos on the west was the main harbour and commercial emporium. It had a market on the east side and the deigma, a place for displaying goods. 7ea and Mounykhia on the east were smaller, and for warships. All three were noted for their splendid ship-sheds.

Graph 푦= 푓(푡), the depth of the water against time, 푡. Explain the concavity and indicate the inflection points. Solution At first the water level, 푦, rises slowly because the base of the vase is wide, and it takes a lot of water to make the depth increase. However, as the vase narrows, the rate at which the water is rising increases. Thus, 푦is increasing at an increasing rate and the graph is concave up. The rate of increase in the water level is at a maximum when the water reaches the middle of the vase, where the diameter is smallest; this is an inflection point. After that, the rate at which 푦increases decreases again, so the graph is concave down. (See Figure 4.11.)

Suppose that 푓has a local maximum at 푥= 푎. Assuming that 푓′(푎) is defined, the definition of the derivative gives 푓′(푎) = lim h→0 푓(푎+ h) −푓(푎) h . Since this is a two-sided limit, we have 푓′(푎) = lim h→0− 푓(푎+ h) −푓(푎) h = lim h→0+ 푓(푎+ h) −푓(푎) h . By the definition of local maximum, 푓(푎+ h) ≤푓(푎) for all sufficiently small h. Thus 푓(푎+ h) − 푓(푎) ≤0 for sufficiently small h. The denominator, h, is negative when we take the limit from the left and positive when we take the limit from the right. Thus lim h→0− 푓(푎+ h) −푓(푎) h ≥0 and lim h→0+ 푓(푎+ h) −푓(푎) h ≤0. Since both these limits are equal to 푓′(푎), we have 푓′(푎) ≥0 and 푓′(푎) ≤0, so we must have 푓′(푎) = 0.

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 1?,"Show that if n is a positive integer, then 1 + 2 + ⋯+ n = n(n + 1) 2 . Solution: Let P(n) be the proposition that the sum of the first n positive integers, 1 + 2 + ⋯n = Extra Examples n(n+1) 2 , is n(n + 1)∕2. We must do two things to prove that P(n) is true for n = 1, 2, 3, ... . Namely, we must show that P(1) is true and that the conditional statement P(k) implies P(k + 1) is true for k = 1, 2, 3, ... . BASIS STEP: P(1) is true, because 1 = 1(1 + 1) 2 . (The left-hand side of this equation is 1 because 1 is the sum of the first positive integer. The right-hand side is found by substituting 1 for n in n(n + 1)∕2.) INDUCTIVE STEP: For the inductive hypothesis we assume that P(k) holds for an arbitrary positive integer k. That is, we assume that If you are rusty simplifying algebraic expressions, this is the time to do some reviewing! 1 + 2 + ⋯+ k = k(k + 1) 2 . Under this assumption, it must be shown that P(k + 1) is true, namely, that 1 + 2 + ⋯+ k + (k + 1) = (k + 1)[(k + 1) + 1] 2 = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 is also true. We now look ahead to see how we might be able to prove that P(k + 1) holds under the assumption that P(k) is true. We observe that the summation in the left-hand side of P(k + 1) is k + 1 more than the summation in the left-hand side of P(k). Our strategy will be to add k + 1 to both sides of the equation in P(k) and simplify the result algebraically to complete the inductive step. We now return to the proof of the inductive step. When we add k + 1 to both sides of the equation in P(k), we obtain 1 + 2 + ⋯+ k + (k + 1) IH = k(k + 1) 2 + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) + 2(k + 1) 2 = (k + 1)(k + 2) 2 . This last equation shows that P(k + 1) is true under the assumption that P(k) is true. This com- pletes the inductive step. We have completed the basis step and the inductive step, so by mathematical induction we know that P(n) is true for all positive integers n. That is, we have proven that 1 + 2 + ⋯+ n = n(n + 1)∕2 for all positive integers n. ◂",1.0,2.1863844
What is the formula for this rule?,"and a(t) = v′(t) = s′′(t) = 6t. Evaluating these functions at t = 1, we obtain v(1) = −1 and a(1) = 6. a. Because v(1) < 0, the particle is moving from right to left. b. Because v(1) < 0 and a(1) > 0, velocity and acceleration are acting in opposite directions. In other words, the particle is being accelerated in the direction opposite the direction in which it is traveling, causing |v(t)| to decrease. The particle is slowing down. Example 3.36 Position and Velocity The position of a particle moving along a coordinate axis is given by s(t) = t3 −9t2 + 24t + 4, t ≥0. a. Find v(t). b. At what time(s) is the particle at rest? c. On what time intervals is the particle moving from left to right? From right to left? d. Use the information obtained to sketch the path of the particle along a coordinate axis. Solution a. The velocity is the derivative of the position function: v(t) = s′(t) = 3t2 −18t + 24. b. The particle is at rest when v(t) = 0, so set 3t2 −18t + 24 = 0. Factoring the left-hand side of the equation produces 3(t −2)(t −4) = 0. Solving, we find that the particle is at rest at t = 2 and t = 4. c. The particle is moving from left to right when v(t) > 0 and from right to left when v(t) < 0.

What is the formula for this rule?,"342 5 / Induction and Recursion For instance, H4 = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 = 25 12 . Use mathematical induction to show that H2n ≥1 + n 2 , whenever n is a nonnegative integer. Solution: To carry out the proof, let P(n) be the proposition that H2n ≥1 + n 2. BASIS STEP: P(0) is true, because H20 = H1 = 1 ≥1 + 0 2. INDUCTIVE STEP: The inductive hypothesis is the statement that P(k) is true, that is, H2k ≥1 + k 2, where k is an arbitrary nonnegative integer. We must show that if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1), which states that H2k+1 ≥1 + k + 1 2 , is also true. So, assuming the inductive hypothesis, it follows that H2k+1 = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + ⋯+ 1 2k + 1 2k + 1 + ⋯+ 1 2k+1 by the definition of harmonic number = H2k + 1 2k + 1 + ⋯+ 1 2k+1 by the definition of 2kth harmonic number IH ≥ ( 1 + k 2 ) + 1 2k + 1 + ⋯+ 1 2k+1 by the inductive hypothesis ≥ ( 1 + k 2 ) + 2k ⋅ 1 2k+1 because there are 2k terms each ≥1∕2k+1 ≥ ( 1 + k 2 ) + 1 2 canceling a common factor of 2k in second term = 1 + k + 1 2 . This establishes the inductive step of the proof. We have completed the basis step and the inductive step. Thus, by mathematical induction P(n) is true for all nonnegative integers n. That is, the inequality H2n ≥1 + n 2 for the harmonic numbers holds for all nonnegative integers n. ◂ Remark: The inequality established here shows that the harmonic series 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + ⋯+ 1 n + ⋯ is a divergent infinite series.

Clinically-insane Gates-funded Japanese researchers have developed mosquitos that spread vaccine and are dubbed ‘flying vaccinators’. Gates is funding the modification of weather paĴerns in part to sell the myth that this is caused by carbon dioxide and he’s funding geoengineering of the skies to change the atmosphere. Some of this came to light with the Gates-backed plan to release tonnes of chalk into the atmosphere to ‘deflect the Sun and cool the planet’. Funny how they do this while the heating effect of the Sun is not factored into climate projections focussed on carbon dioxide. The reason is that they want to reduce carbon dioxide (so don’t mention the Sun), but at the same time they do want to reduce the impact of the Sun which is so essential to human life and health. I have mentioned the sun-cholesterol-vitamin D connection as they demonise the Sun with warnings about skin cancer (caused by the chemicals in sun cream they tell you to splash on). They come from the other end of the process with statin drugs to reduce cholesterol that turns sunlight into vitamin D. A lack of vitamin D leads to a long list of health effects and how vitamin D levels must have fallen with people confined to their homes over ‘Covid’. Gates is funding other forms of geoengineering and most importantly chemtrails which are dropping heavy metals, aluminium and self-replicating nanotechnology onto the Earth which is killing the natural world.

State the COROLLARY 2.,"Let n and r be nonnegative integers with r ≤n. Then C(n, r) = C(n, n −r). Proof: From Theorem 2 it follows that C(n, r) = n! r! (n −r)! and C(n, n −r) = n! (n −r)! [n −(n −r)]! = n! (n −r)! r!. Hence, C(n, r) = C(n, n −r). We can also prove Corollary 2 without relying on algebraic manipulation. Instead, we can use a combinatorial proof. We describe this important type of proof in Definition 1. Definition 1 A combinatorial proof of an identity is a proof that uses counting arguments to prove that both sides of the identity count the same objects but in different ways or a proof that is based on showing that there is a bijection between the sets of objects counted by the two sides of the identity. These two types of proofs are called double counting proofs and bijective proofs, respectively. Many identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved using combinatorial proofs. We now show how to prove Corollary 2 using a combinatorial proof. We will provide both a double counting proof and a bijective proof, both based on the same basic idea. Combinatorial proofs are almost always much shorter and provide more insights than proofs based on algebraic manipulation.",1.0,5.6931195

The graphs of even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function is one in which f(−x) = −f(x) for all x in the domain, and the graph of the function is symmetric about the origin. Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from −a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are symmetric about the y-axis.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Yes, what is ‘human’? That is what we are supposed to be, right? I mean ‘human’? True, but ‘human’ is the experience not the ‘I’. Break it down to basics and ‘human’ is the way that information is processed. If we are to experience and interact with this band of frequency we call the ‘world’ we must have a vehicle that operates within that band of frequency. Our consciousness in its prime form cannot do that; it is way beyond the frequency of the human realm. My consciousness or awareness could not tap these keys and pick up the cup in front of me in the same way that radio station A cannot interact with radio station B when they are on different frequencies. The human body is the means through which we have that interaction. I have long described the body as a biological computer which processes information in a way that allows consciousness to experience this reality. The body is a receiver, transmiĴer and processor of information in a particular way that we call human. We visually perceive only the world of the five senses in a wakened state – that is the limit of the body’s visual decoding system. In truth it’s not even visual in the way we experience ‘visual reality’ as I will come to in a moment. We are ‘human’ because the body processes the information sources of human into a reality and behaviour system that we perceive as human. Why does an elephant act like an elephant and not like a human or a duck? The elephant’s biological computer is a different information field and processes information according to that program into a visual and behaviour type we call an elephant. The same applies to everything in our reality. These body information fields are perpetuated through procreation (like making a copy of a soĞware program). The Cult wants to break that cycle and intervene technologically to transform the human information field into one that will change what we call humanity.

What is the formula for 16.6 APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION TO PROBABILITY?,"Using Dijkstra’s algorithm to find a shortest path from a to z. Remark: In performing Dijkstra’s algorithm it is sometimes more convenient to keep track of labels of vertices in each step using a table instead of redrawing the graph for each step. Next, we use an inductive argument to show that Dijkstra’s algorithm produces the length of a shortest path between two vertices a and z in an undirected connected weighted graph. Take as the inductive hypothesis the following assertion: At the kth iteration (i ) the label of every vertex v in S is the length of a shortest path from a to this vertex, and (ii ) the label of every vertex not in S is the length of a shortest path from a to this vertex that contains only (besides the vertex itself) vertices in S. When k = 0, before any iterations are carried out, S = ∅, so the length of a shortest path from a to a vertex other than a is ∞. Hence, the basis case is true. Assume that the inductive hypothesis holds for the kth iteration. Let v be the vertex added to S at the (k + 1)st iteration, so v is a vertex not in S at the end of the kth iteration with the smallest label (in the case of ties, any vertex with smallest label may be used). From the inductive hypothesis we see that the vertices in S before the (k + 1)st iteration are labeled with the length of a shortest path from a. Also, v must be labeled with the length of a shortest path to it from a. If this were not the case, at the end of the kth iteration there would be a path of length less than Lk(v) containing a vertex not in S [because Lk(v) is the length of a shortest path from a to v containing only vertices in S after the kth iteration]. Let u be the first vertex not in S in such a path. There is a path with length less than Lk(v) from a to u containing only vertices of S. This contradicts the choice of v. Hence, (i) holds at the end of the (k + 1)st iteration. Let u be a vertex not in S after k + 1 iterations. A shortest path from a to u containing only elements of S either contains v or it does not.

What is the formula for this rule?,"779 25.5 Resistors in Series Resistor with a Nonconstant Cross Section Up to now the discussion has assumed that a resistor has the same cross-sectional area, A, and the same resistivity, , everywhere along its length (this was the implicit assumption in the derivation leading to equation 25.11). This is, of course, not always the case. How do we handle the analysis of a resistor whose cross-sectional area is a function of the position x along the resistor, A(x), and/or whose resistivity can change as a function of position, (x)? We simply divide the resistor into many very short pieces of length x and sum over all of them, since equation 25.15 says that the total resistance is the sum of all of the resistances of the individual short pieces; then we take the limit x→0. If this sounds like an integra- tion to you, you are right. The general formula for computing the resistance of a resistor of length L with a nonuniform cross-sectional area, A(x), is R x A x dx L = ( ) ( ) . 0 ∫  (25.16) A concrete example will help clarify this equation. and then measure the potential difference. If the battery is no longer functional, it may still provide its rated potential difference when not connected, but its potential difference may drop to zero when connected to an external resistance.

Consider the reaction between nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide: NO2(g) 1 CO(g) - £ NO(g) 1 CO2(g) If this reaction were an elementary step—that is, if the mechanism consisted of only one step—we could immediately write the overall rate law as Rate 5 k3NO24 3CO4 But, as you saw in Sample Problem 16.3, experimental data show the rate law is Rate 5 k3NO242 Thus, the overall reaction cannot be elementary. A proposed two-step mechanism is (1) NO2(g) 1 NO2(g) - £ NO3(g) 1 NO(g) 3slow; rate determining4 (2) NO3(g) 1 CO(g) - £ NO2(g) 1 CO2(g) 3fast4 In this mechanism, NO3 functions as a reaction intermediate, a substance formed and used up during the reaction. Even though it does not appear in the overall balanced equation, a reaction intermediate is essential for the reaction to occur. Intermediates are less stable than the reactants and products, but unlike much less stable transition states, they have normal bonds and can sometimes be isolated. Rate laws for the two elementary steps listed above are (1) Rate1 5 k13NO24 3NO24 5 k13NO242 (2) Rate2 5 k23NO34 3CO4 Three key points to notice about this mechanism are • If k1 5 k, the rate law for the rate-determining step (step 1) becomes identical to the observed rate law. • Because the first step is slow, [NO3] is low. As soon as any NO3 forms, it is consumed by the fast second step, so the reaction takes as long as the first step does. • CO does not appear in the rate law (reaction order 5 0) because it takes part in the mechanism after the rate-determining step.",1.0,0.64998996

What is the formula for this rule?,"that line segment with two line segments of length 1 3ln −1 in the shape of an equilateral triangle, we know that Nn = 4Nn −1 and ln = ln −1 3 . Therefore, the number of sides of figure Fn is Nn = 4n · 3 and the length of each side is ln = ⎛ ⎝1 3 ⎞ ⎠ n . Therefore, to calculate the perimeter of Fn, we multiply the number of sides Nn and the length of each side ln. We conclude that the perimeter of Fn is given by Ln = Nn · ln = 3 · ⎛ ⎝4 3 ⎞ ⎠ n . Therefore, the length of the perimeter of Koch’s snowflake is L = lim n →∞Ln = ∞. b. Let Tn denote the area of each new triangle created when forming Fn. For n = 0, T0 is the area of the original equilateral triangle. Therefore, T0 = A0 = 3/4. For n ≥1, since the lengths of the sides of the new triangle are 1/3 the length of the sides of Fn −1, we have Tn = ⎛ ⎝1 3 ⎞ ⎠ 2 Tn −1 = 1 9 · Tn −1. Therefore, Tn = ⎛ ⎝1 9 ⎞ ⎠ n · 3 4 . Since a new triangle is formed on each side of Fn −1, An = An −1 + Nn −1 · Tn = An −1 + ⎛ ⎝3 · 4n −1⎞ ⎠· ⎛ ⎝1 9 ⎞ ⎠ n · 3 4 = An −1 + 3 4 · ⎛ ⎝4 9 ⎞ ⎠ n · 3 4 .

The energy can take several forms, but the most important are decom- position by heat (thermal) and by electricity (electrolytic). The products are either elements or elements and smaller compounds. Thermal Decomposition When the energy absorbed is heat, the reaction is called a thermal decomposition. (A Greek delta, D, above the yield arrow indicates strong heating is required.) Many metal oxides, chlorates, and perchlorates release oxygen when strongly heated.

Gas-electric hybrid vehicles convert some or most of this kinetic energy into reusable electric energy stored in a large battery. However, there is a way to accomplish this energy storage without the use of a large battery by storing the energy temporarily in a flywheel (Figure 10.33). Flywheel kinetic energy recovery systems were pioneered by Flybrid Systems and are being used in Formula 1 races and endurance races such as Le Mans.

The proton-proton chain starts with two protons forming a deuteron plus a positron. This is a weak interaction process and takes a long time, approximately 10 billion years on average (half-life). This explains why the Sun has already existed for approximately 5 billion years and did not explode right after it formed. The deuteron from the initial reaction can quickly capture another proton and form helium-3; the positron from the initial reaction annihilates almost instantaneously with an electron: p p d e Q d p Q e e + →+ + + → + + = MeV He = MeV 2 3 0 42 5 49 . . + + → e Q – . 2 1 02 = MeV.

What is the definition of 23.2 Definition of Electric Potential?,"The potential energy of a charged particle, q, in an electric field depends on the magnitude of the charge as well as that of the electric field. A quantity that is independent of the charge on the particle is the electric potential, V, defined in terms of the electric potential energy as V U q = . (23.6) Because U is proportional to q, V is independent of q, which makes it a useful variable. The electric potential, V, characterizes an electrical property of a point in space even when no charge, q, is placed at that point. In contrast to the electric field, which is a vector, the electric potential is a scalar. It has a value everywhere in space, but has no direction. In Chapter 6, we saw that we can always add an arbitrary constant to the potential energy with- out changing any observable consequence and that only differences in potential energy are physically meaningful. Since the electric potential is proportional to the potential energy, the same is true for it. Stating a difference in electric potentials is unambiguous, but stating a value for the electric potential itself always implies a normalization condition, which is usually that the potential is zero at an infinite distance. The difference in electric potential, V, between an initial point and final point, Vf – Vi, can be expressed in terms of the electric potential energy at each point:   V V V U q U q U q = – = – = . f i f i (23.7) Combining equations 23.2 and 23.7 yields a relationship between the change in electric potential and the work done by an electric field on a charge: V W q = e – . (23.8) Taking the electric potential energy to be zero at infinity, as in equation 23.3, gives the elec- tric potential at a point as V W q = e ∞ – , , (23.9) where We,∞ is the work done by the electric field on the charge when it is brought in to the point from infinity. An electric potential can have a positive, a negative, or a zero value, but it has no direction. The SI units for electric potential are joules/coulomb (J/C). This combination has been named the volt (V) for Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–​ 1827) (note the use of the roman V for the unit, whereas the italicized V is used for the physical quantity of electric potential): 1 V 1 J 1 C ≡ .

Find a spanning tree with minimal total weight containing the edges {e, i} and {g, k} in the weighted graph in Figure 3. 22. Describe an algorithm for finding a spanning tree with minimal weight containing a specified set of edges in a connected weighted undirected simple graph. 23. Express the algorithm devised in Exercise 22 in pseudocode. Sollin’s algorithm produces a minimum spanning tree from a connected weighted simple graph G = (V, E) by successively adding groups of edges. Suppose that the vertices in V are or- dered. This produces an ordering of the edges where {u0, v0} precedes {u1, v1} if u0 precedes u1 or if u0 = u1 and v0 pre- cedes v1. The algorithm begins by simultaneously choosing the edge of least weight incident to each vertex. The first edge in the ordering is taken in the case of ties. This produces a graph with no simple circuits, that is, a forest of trees (Ex- ercise 24 asks for a proof of this fact). Next, simultaneously choose for each tree in the forest the shortest edge between a vertex in this tree and a vertex in a different tree. Again the first edge in the ordering is chosen in the case of ties. (This pro- duces a graph with no simple circuits containing fewer trees than were present before this step; see Exercise 24.) Continue the process of simultaneously adding edges connecting trees until n −1 edges have been chosen. At this stage a minimum spanning tree has been constructed. ∗24.

What is the formula for this rule?,"w to this complete matching produces a complete matching from W1 to W2. Case (ii): Suppose that for some j with 1 ≤j ≤k, there is a subset W′ 1 of j vertices such that there are exactly j neighbors of these vertices in W2. Let W′ 2 be the set of these neighbors. Then, by the inductive hypothesis there is a complete matching from W′ 1 to W′ 2. Remove these 2j vertices from W1 and W2 and all incident edges to produce a bipartite graph K with bipartition (W1 −W′ 1, W2 −W′ 2). We will show that the graph K satisfies the condition |N(A)| ≥|A| for all subsets A of W1 − W′ 1. If not, there would be a subset of t vertices of W1 −W′ 1 where 1 ≤t ≤k + 1 −j such that the vertices in this subset have fewer than t vertices of W2 −W′ 2 as neighbors. Then, the set of j + t vertices of W1 consisting of these t vertices together with the j vertices we removed from W1 has fewer than j + t neighbors in W2, contradicting the hypothesis that |N(A)| ≥|A| for all A ⊆W1. Hence, by the inductive hypothesis, the graph K has a complete matching. Combining this complete matching with the complete matching from W′ 1 to W′ 2, we obtain a complete matching from W1 to W2. We have shown that in both cases there is a complete matching from W1 to W2. This com- pletes the inductive step and completes the proof. We have used strong induction to prove Hall’s marriage theorem. Although our proof is elegant, it does have some drawbacks. In particular, we cannot construct an algorithm based on this proof that finds a complete matching in a bipartite graph. For a constructive proof that can be used as the basis of an algorithm, see [Gi85]. 10.2.6 Some Applications of Special Types of Graphs We conclude this section by introducing some additional graph models that involve the special types of graph we have discussed in this section.",0.0,0.07894714

Add an instruction to the BFS algorithm to mark each vertex as it is encoun- tered. When BFS terminates we have found (all the vertices of) one component of the graph. Repeat, starting at an un- marked vertex, and continue in this way until all vertices have been marked. 39. Trees 41. Use depth-first search on each component. 43. If an edge uv is not followed while we are processing vertex u during the depth-first search pro- cess, then it must be the case that the vertex v had already been visited. There are two cases. If vertex v was visited af- ter we started processing u, then, because we are not finished processing u yet, v must appear in the subtree rooted at u (and hence, must be a descendant of u). On the other hand, if the processing of v had already begun before we started process- ing u, then why wasn’t this edge followed at that time? It must be that we had not finished processing v, in other words, that we are still forming the subtree rooted at v, so u is a descen- dant of v, and hence, v is an ancestor of u. 45. Certainly these two procedures produce the identical spanning trees if the graph we are working with is a tree itself, because in this case there is only one spanning tree (the whole graph). This is the only case in which that happens, however. If the origi- nal graph has any other edges, then by Exercise 43 they must be back edges and hence, join a vertex to an ancestor or de- scendant, whereas by Exercise 34, they must connect vertices at the same level or at levels that differ by 1. Clearly these two possibilities are mutually exclusive. Therefore, there can be no edges other than tree edges if the two spanning trees are to be the same. 47. Because the edges not in the spanning tree are not followed in the process, we can ignore them. Thus, we can assume that the graph was a rooted tree to begin with. The basis step is trivial (there is only one vertex), so we assume the inductive hypothesis that breadth-first search ap- plied to trees with n vertices have their vertices visited in order of their level in the tree and consider a tree T with n + 1 ver- tices. The last vertex to be visited during breadth-first search of this tree, say v, is the one that was added last to the list of vertices waiting to be processed. It was added when its par- ent, say u, was being processed. We must show that v is at the lowest (bottom-most, i.e., numerically greatest) level of the tree. Suppose not; say vertex x, whose parent is vertex w, is at a lower level. Then w is at a lower level than u. Clearly v must be a leaf, because any child of v could not have been seen before v is seen.",0.0,-4.245163
What is the formula for 264 Chapter 8 • Electron Configuration and Chemical Periodicity?,"752 Chapter 24 Capacitors with , the electric permittivity of the dielectric. In other words, the electric permittivity of a dielectric is the product of the electric permittivity of free space (the vacuum) and the dielectric constant of the dielectric: = 0. (24.19) Note that this replacement of 0 by  is all that is needed to generalize expressions for the capacitance, such as equations 24.6, 24.8, and 24.10, from the values applicable for a capacitor with vacuum between its plates to those appropriate when the capacitor is completely filled with a dielectric. We can now see how the capacitance is increased by adding a dielectric between the plates. The potential difference across a parallel plate capacitor is V Ed qd A = = 0 . Therefore, we can write the capacitance as C q V A d C = = = air 0 . The dielectric strength of a material is a measure of its ability to withstand potential difference. If the electric field strength in the dielectric exceeds the dielectric strength, the dielectric breaks down and begins to conduct charge between the plates via a spark, which usually destroys the capacitor. Thus, a useful capacitor must contain a dielectric that not only provides a given capacitance but also enables the device to hold the required potential difference without breaking down. Capacitors are normally specified by the value of their capacitance and by the maximum potential difference that they are designed to handle. The dielectric constant of vacuum is defined to be 1, and the dielectric constant of air is close to 1.0. The dielectric constants and dielectric strengths of air and of other common materials used as dielectrics are listed in Table 24.1.

He was part of the committees that designed the programming language ALGOL using what is now called the Backus–Naur form for the description of the syntax of this language. (The development of ALGOL led to the development of other programming languages, including Pascal and C.) Later, Backus worked on the mathematics of families of sets and on a functional style of programming.

As a boy he became interested in astronomy. Not only did he observe heavenly bodies, but he also computed the orbits of comets and asteroids. Naur attended Copenhagen University, receiving his degree in 1949. He spent 1950 and 1951 in Cambridge, where he used an early computer to calculate the motions of comets and planets. After returning to Denmark, he continued working in astronomy but kept his ties to computing. In 1955 he served as a consultant to the building of the first Danish computer. In 1959 Naur made the switch from astronomy to computing as a full-time activity. His first job as a full-time computer scientist was participating in the development of the programming language ALGOL. From 1960 to 1967 he worked on the development of compilers for ALGOL and COBOL. From 1969 until 1999 he was professor of computer science at Copenhagen University, where he has worked in the area of programming methodology. His research interests included the design, structure, and performance of computer programs. Naur was a pioneer in both the areas of software architecture and software engineering.

State the THEOREM 1.,"1 Insiagram and Commodiiic8tion It can be quite difficult at times to pimure what this means. So, let's take Instagram as a platform and analyze what goes on there in terms of everyday commodifioation. You're sitting on a train, idly scrolling through Instagram when you remember you have a cool image from outside the railway station to share, In this instance, we have two aspects of commodMcation. The *'produser' is always commodified in two ways: firstly, the content that is produced is used as a commodity by the platform, and secondly, our activity scrolling through the Instagram feed means that we are exposed to advertising, which transforms us into a commodity being sold to the customers of the platform. You are not receiving anything financially for posting that image. You may well be accruing other kinds of capital though. Pierre Bourdleu [1984] notes that there are various kinds of non-economic capital, and our activity on social media means that we accrue social capital and cultural capital through our activities, Social capital comes from our status, and cultural capital concerns the possession of, or indication of possession of, cultural goods. Both can be accrued in social media activity and can be indicated by metrics such as likes and comments on posts. However, the economic capital of our amivity is always held by the platform. That is, unless we're a paid influencer one of a very small senior of users of social media whose activity also generates capital for the platform. So, our 'active' actmty is commodrfied. So is the passive part of cur lnstagram use. Aimless scrolling on the platform might seem like an innocent way to while away a few minutes [or hours), but that activity is recorded and analysed to make you a more efficient unit of economic exchange. lnstagram actively measures what you look at, l.e. when you stop scrolling, for how long, what you comment and what you like. This all goes into the data profile you have as an lnstagram user, and lt is this which is traded as a commodity by the platfomi. Whether act we or passive, you are commodified - by every platform.",0.0,-4.726925

What is the formula for this rule?,"phi71385_ch06_258-305.indd 263 10/12/20 11:11 AM C H AP T ER 6 Merchandising Operations and the Multistep Income Statement 263 Periodic Inventory System A periodic inventory system updates the inventory records for merchandise purchases, sales, and returns only at the end of the accounting period. Although simple to maintain, a major drawback of a periodic system is that accurate records of the inventory on hand and the inventory that has been sold are unavailable during the accounting period. To deter mine these amounts, employees must physically count the inventory, which they do at the end of the period, when the store is “closed for inventory.” Based on the inventory count, the cost of ending inventory (EI) is determined and subtracted to calculate the cost of goods sold (BI + P − EI = CGS). These amounts are then used to adjust the balances in the Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold accounts. Perpetual Inventory System A perpetual inventory system updates inventory records every time an item is bought, sold, or returned. You may not realize it, but the bar-code scanners at Walmart’s checkouts serve two purposes: (1) they calculate and record the sales revenue for each product you’re buying and (2) they remove the product and its cost from Walmart’s inventory records. Similar scanners are used back in the “employees only” part of the store, where products are unloaded from the trucks or returned to suppliers. As a result of this continuous, or “perpetual,” updating, the balances in Walmart’s Inventory and Cost of Goods Sold accounts are always up to date. Inventory Control A perpetual inventory system provides the best inventory control because its continuous tracking of transactions allows companies to instantly determine the quantity of products on the shelves and to evaluate the amount of time they have spent there. Using this information, companies can better manage their inventory and save a great deal of money in financing and storage charges. Another benefit of a perpetual inventory sys tem is that it allows managers to estimate shrinkage, the term for loss of inventory from theft, fraud, and error. You might wonder how companies can estimate how much of their inventory is missing because isn’t it, by definition, missing? They use the information in the perpetual inventory system and the following version of the cost of goods sold equation: BI + P − CGS = EI. To illustrate, assume Walmart reports the following for one of its lines of cell phones.",0.0,-1.0443988
What is the formula for this rule?,"Italy was a redesignation of diagnosis. Lies and corruption were to become the real ‘pandemic’ fuelled by a pathetically-compliant medical system taking its orders from the tiny few at the top of their national hierarchy who answered to the World Health Organization which answers to Gates and the Cult. Doctors were told – ordered – to diagnose a particular set of symptoms ‘Covid-19’ and put that on the death certificate for any cause of death if the patient had tested positive with a test not testing for the virus or had ‘Covid’ symptoms like the flu. The United States even introduced big financial incentives to manipulate the figures with hospitals receiving £4,600 from the Medicare system for diagnosing someone with regular pneumonia, $13,000 if they made the diagnosis from the same symptoms ‘Covid-19’ pneumonia, and $39, 000 if they put a ‘Covid’ diagnosed patient on a ventilator that would almost certainly kill them. A few – painfully and pathetically few – medical whistleblowers revealed (before Cult-owned YouTube deleted their videos) that they had been instructed to ‘let the patient crash’ and put them straight on a ventilator instead of going through a series of far less intrusive and dangerous methods as they would have done before the pandemic hoax began and the financial incentives kicked in. We are talking cold-blooded murder given that ventilators are so damaging to respiratory systems they are usually the last step before heaven awaits.

What is the formula for THE DISCURSIVE FUNCTIONS OF SOCIAL MEDIA?,"ani (2018) argues that truth Itself has been under assault in contemporary society, particularly during the presidency of Donald Trump. Kakutani asserts that the proliferation of falsehoods, Iles and the disregard for objective facts have significant consequences for democracy and public discourse. Essentially, the concept of truth has been undermined and devalued, with the rise of take news, alternative facts and the manipulation of information of which Trump was a major perpetrator. Kakutani argues that the erosion of truth has far-reaching implications, Including the erosion of trust in Institutions, the polarisation of society and the distortion of public discourse. Similarly, Yochai Benkler, Robert Farts and Hal Roberts (2018) argue that it is the media ecosystem of the digital age that has been Instrumental in shaping the dynamics of contemporary American politics. The authors argue that the convergence of technology, media platforms and political polarization has created an environment where misinformation, propaganda and extreme ideologies thrive. They focus on the 2016 US presidential election as a case study and examine how various media sources, both traditional and digital, influenced public opinion and political outcomes, Benkler and colleagues contend that while traditional news outlets still play a crucial role in shaping the national discourse, the rise of social media platforms has transformed the dynamics of information dissemination. Partisan websites and hyper-partisan social media accounts have created echo chambers and filter bubbles that reinforce individuals pre-existing beliefs and ideologies. They argue that these platforms have facilitated the spread Of misinformation and disinformation, leading to increased polarisation and the radicalisation Of political views. While traditional media generally adheres to journalistic standards and fact-checking, online platforms are more susceptible to manipulation, and their algorithms often prioritise engagement and sensationalism over accuracy and reliability. These analyses of Donald Trumps fake news agenda contend that social media platforms (and the digital media ecosystem in general) have a key role in the creation and dissemination of the discourses that legitimised Trumps position (in the eyes Of his supporters). Lee Mclntyre {2018] contends that the result Of these discourses is that we are living in an era defined by the rejection of objective facts and the ascendancy of emotion, belief and personal bias in shaping public opinion and political discourse. Mclntyre argues that the concept of post-truth has gained prominence in recent years, with profound consequences for democracy and the pursuit of truth. The dangers of post-truth are multiple and manifest, there is a considerable Impact on public policy debates, a distortion of scientific knowledge, and a general undermining of democratic processes. For Mclntyre, post-truth politics allows for the manipulation and exploitation of public sentiment, creating an environment where misinformation and alternative facts can flourish. Pg 132 The role of social media and social media discourses, then, is - 1ust like previous media - to legltimlse particular ideologies. The speed and amplification of these discourses are major issues though, resulting in highly polarised views and a lack of consensus which is vital for functioning democracies. Social media discourse prioritlses engagement over truth, leading to the proliferation of fake news and misinformation In contemporanr society - all the while legitimising the positions of particular actors (including social media platforms) in contemporary society.

What is the formula for N0 K?,"4.12 are x = ±1. From the graph of f in Figure 4.18, we see that f has an absolute maximum at x = 1 and an absolute minimum at x = −1. Hence, f has a local maximum at x = 1 and a local minimum at x = −1. (Note that if f has an absolute extremum over an interval I at a point c that is not an endpoint of I, then f has a local extremum at c.) Figure 4.18 This function has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. Find all critical points for f(x) = x3 −1 2x2 −2x + 1. Locating Absolute Extrema The extreme value theorem states that a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. As shown in Figure 4.13, one or both of these absolute extrema could occur at an endpoint. If an absolute extremum does not occur at an endpoint, however, it must occur at an interior point, in which case the absolute extremum is a local extremum. Therefore, by Fermat’s Theorem, the point c at which the local extremum occurs must be a critical point. We summarize this result in the following theorem. Theorem 4.3: Location of Absolute Extrema Let f be a continuous function over a closed, bounded interval I. The absolute maximum of f over I and the absolute minimum of f over I must occur at endpoints of I or at critical points of f in I. With this idea in mind, let’s examine a procedure for locating absolute extrema. Problem-Solving Strategy: Locating Absolute Extrema over a Closed Interval Consider a continuous function f defined over the closed interval [a, b]. 1. Evaluate f at the endpoints x = a and x = b. 2. Find all critical points of f that lie over the interval (a, b) and evaluate f at those critical points. Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives 377",0.0,-5.345768

Just today, you likely drove on roads that the government paid to build and maintain. You may attend a public college or university, paid for, at least in part, by government. Where does a government get its money? By taxing citizens. Think of the different taxes you pay. Do you think you pay more than, less than, or just about your fair share in taxes? How do you determine what your fair share is? As you read this chapter, see if you can answer these ques- tions. You can check your answers against those we provide on page 605 at the end of this chapter. to use the tax code to help reduce this in- equality. Romney argued that increasing income inequality had not been caused by changes in taxes and that increasing taxes on individuals with high incomes was likely to reduce economic efficiency while having little effect on inequality. The questions raised by the debate over taxes during the 2012 election campaign were not new. Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan proposed significant cuts in income taxes that they claimed would enhance economic efficiency, while their op- ponents claimed that the tax cuts rewarded high-income taxpayers and increased in- come inequality. The design of the tax sys- tem and the criteria to use in evaluating it are important questions. Has the tax code im- proved economic efficiency? Has the govern- ment, through its tax and other policies, had much effect on the distribution of income? We explore these questions in this chapter.

McKinnon, “Millionaire’s Tax to Be Tough Sell,” Wall Street Journal, September 19, 2011 . Taxes affect the incomes of households and the decisions made by businesses.

Before the tax cut, Microsoft had never paid a dividend. After the tax cut, in a single year, Microsoft paid out more than $40 billion in dividends. Cutting the tax on dividends was intended to improve economic efficiency, but changing the tax code can serve other purposes as well. The United States has the most un- equal distribution of income of any high- income country, and income inequality in the United States has been increasing in recent years. As the 2012 presidential election campaign heated up, one of sev- eral issues separating President Barack Obama from Republican contender former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney was whether changes in the tax system should be used to reduce income inequality. President Obama argued that the tax cut on dividends, as well as other tax cuts enacted during the early 2000s, had increased the burden on in- dividuals with low and moderate incomes, while the burden on the wealthy and on corporations had been reduced, increasing the level of income inequality. He proposed Should the Government Use the Tax System to Reduce Inequality?",0.0,-5.179566

Sample Problem 4.10  Identifying the Type of Redox Reaction Problem ​ Classify each of the following redox reactions as a combination, decomposition, or displacement reaction, write a balanced molecular equation for each, as well as total and net ionic equations for part (c), and identify the oxidizing and reducing agents: (a) Magnesium(s) 1 nitrogen(g) - £ magnesium nitride(s) (b) Hydrogen peroxide(l) - £ water 1 oxygen gas (c) Aluminum(s) 1 lead(II) nitrate(aq) - £ aluminum nitrate(aq) 1 lead(s) Plan ​ To decide on reaction type, recall that combination reactions produce fewer products than reactants, decomposition reactions produce more products, and displacement reactions have the same number of reactants and products. The oxidation number (O.N.) becomes more positive for the reducing agent and less positive for the oxidizing agent. Solution ​ (a) Combination: two substances form one. This reaction occurs, along with formation of magnesium oxide, when magnesium burns in air, which is mostly N2: 3Mg(s) N2(g) ± £ Mg3N2(s) 0 0 2 3 Mg is the reducing agent; N2 is the oxidizing agent.

A large fraction of the devices we rely on—including pacemak- ers, televisions, computers, cell phones, hair dryers, and locomotives—use electric energy. It is therefore important to understand how electrically powered devices process and store this energy. We start by looking at electric energy and electric potential in order to understand the relationship between them and see how to calculate both. Figure 23.1 shows the result of calculating the electric potential due to four identical charges arranged at the corners of a tetrahedron. Th e electric potential is visualized as fi ve nested surfaces representing points at which its magnitude is constant. Th e highest values of the potential occur clos- est to the charges, and the equipotential surfaces approximate spheres around each charge. Th e equipotential surfaces with the lowest values are farthest away from the charges and approximate spheres around the center of mass of the combined charges.

When X-rays are incident on a crystal, several different planes can function as diffrac- tion gratings. Some examples are illustrated in Figure 34.50. These planes do not have the spacing a between them. To study the atomic structure of a substance using X-ray diffraction, X-rays can be scattered nearly parallel to the surface of a sample (Figure 34.51a). Alternatively, the X-rays can be transmitted through the sample and detected on the opposite side of the sample (Figure 34.51b). For the parallel scattering method, the angle of incidence  should equal the angle of observation. For the transmission method, the observed angle is twice the Figure 34.47 ​ A cubic crystal lattice with interatomic spacing a. a a a Figure 34.48 ​ Schematic diagram of X-rays scattering off planes of atoms in a crystal. a a bau13881_ch34.indd 1064 7/18/12 9:55 AM",0.0,-2.418657
What is the formula for 2 D3O24?,"Comparative Advantage in International Trade 277 Comparative Advantage in International Trade Why have businesses around the world increasingly looked for markets in other coun- tries? Why have consumers increasingly purchased goods and services made in other countries? People trade for one reason: Trade makes them better off. Whenever a buyer and seller agree to a sale, they must both believe they are better off; otherwise, there would be no sale. This outcome must hold whether the buyer and seller live in the same city or in different countries. As we will see, governments are more likely to interfere with inter- national trade than they are with domestic trade, but the reasons for the interference are more political than economic. A Brief Review of Comparative Advantage In Chapter 2, we discussed the key economic concept of comparative advantage. Comparative advantage is the ability of an individual, a firm, or a country to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than competitors. Recall that opportu- nity cost is the highest-valued alternative that must be given up to engage in an activ- ity. People, firms, and countries specialize in economic activities in which they have a comparative advantage. In trading, we benefit from the comparative advantage of other people (or firms or countries), and they benefit from our comparative advantage. A good way to think of comparative advantage is to recall the example in Chapter 2 of you and your neighbor picking fruit. Your neighbor is better at picking both apples and cherries than you are. Why, then, doesn’t your neighbor pick both types of fruit? Because the opportunity cost to your neighbor of picking her own apples is very high: She is a par- ticularly skilled cherry picker, and every hour spent picking apples is an hour taken away from picking cherries. You can pick apples at a much lower opportunity cost than your neighbor, so you have a comparative advantage in picking apples. Your neighbor can pick cherries at a much lower opportunity cost than you can, so she has a comparative advan- tage in picking cherries. Your neighbor is better off specializing in picking cherries, and you are better off specializing in picking apples. You can then trade some of your apples for some of your neighbor’s cherries, and both of you will end up with more of each fruit.",0.0,-7.772786

What is the formula for this rule?,"way to control federal government spending on Medicare is to have a board of experts decide whether new medical technologies are worth their higher costs. If the board de- cides that they are not worth the costs, Medicare would not pay for them. Other economists and policymakers argue that the costs to beneficiaries should more closely repre- sent the costs of providing medical services. This result might be attained by raising premiums, deductibles, and copayments or by “means testing,” which would limit the Medicare benefits high-income individuals receive. Po- litical columnist David Brooks has summarized these two ways to restrain the growth of spending on Medicare: “From the top, a body of experts can be empowered to make rationing decisions. . . . Alternatively, at the bottom, costs can be shifted to beneficiaries with premium sup- ports to help them handle the burden.” a. What are “rationing decisions”? How would these deci- sions restrain the growth of Medicare spending? b. How would shifting the costs of Medicare to beneficia- ries restrain the growth of Medicare spending? What does Brooks mean by “premium supports”? c. Should Congress and the president be concerned about the growth of Medicare spending? If so, which of these approaches should they adopt or is there a third approach that might be better? (Note:This last question is normative and has no definitive answer. It is intended to lead you to consider possible approaches to the Medicare program.) Based on David Brooks, “The Missing Fifth,” New York Times, May 9, 2011.",0.0,-5.716791

"What is the formula for 8.8 PROBABILITY, MEAN, AND MEDIAN?","Use Algorithm 5 to find 3644 mod 645. Solution: Algorithm 5 initially sets x = 1 and power = 3 mod 645 = 3. In the computation of 3644 mod 645, this algorithm determines 32j mod 645 for j = 1, 2, ... , 9 by successively squaring and reducing modulo 645. If aj = 1 (where aj is the bit in the jth position in the binary expansion of 644, which is (1010000100)2), it multiplies the current value of x by 32j mod 645 and reduces the result modulo 645. Here are the steps used: i = 0: Because a0 = 0, we have x = 1 and power = 32 mod 645 = 9 mod 645 = 9; i = 1: Because a1 = 0, we have x = 1 and power = 92 mod 645 = 81 mod 645 = 81; i = 2: Because a2 = 1, we have x = 1 ⋅81 mod 645 = 81 and power = 812 mod 645 = 6561 mod 645 = 111; i = 3: Because a3 = 0, we have x = 81 and power = 1112 mod 645 = 12,321 mod 645 = 66; i = 4: Because a4 = 0, we have x = 81 and power = 662 mod 645 = 4356 mod 645 = 486; i = 5: Because a5 = 0, we have x = 81 and power = 4862 mod 645 = 236,196 mod 645 = 126; i = 6: Because a6 = 0, we have x = 81 and power = 1262 mod 645 = 15,876 mod 645 = 396; i = 7: Because a7 = 1, we find that x = (81 ⋅396) mod 645 = 471 and power = 3962 mod 645 = 156,816 mod 645 = 81; i = 8: Because a8 = 0, we have x = 471 and power = 812 mod 645 = 6561 mod 645 = 111; i = 9: Because a9 = 1, we find that x = (471 ⋅111) mod 645 = 36. This shows that following the steps of Algorithm 5 produces the result 3644 mod 645 = 36. ◂ Algorithm 5 is quite efficient; it uses O((log m)2 log n) bit operations to find bn mod m (see Exercise 64).",0.0,-5.72502

This happens whether we’re adjusting supplies, prepaid rent, or even long-term assets like buildings, equipment, and software. When accounting for the use of long-term assets like buildings, equipment, and software, there is one slight difference in how the carrying value is reduced, as we’ll explain next. (c) Depreciation Is Recorded for Use of Equipment The computer equipment, which was estimated to last two years, has now been used for one month, represent ing an estimated expense of $400. The expense recognition principle (“matching”) indicates that when equipment is used to generate revenues in the current period, part of its cost should be transferred to an expense account in that period. This process is referred to as depreciation, so an income statement account named Depreciation Expense reports the cost of equipment use in the current period. On the balance sheet, we reduce the amount reported for equipment, but we don’t take the depreciation directly out of the Equipment account. Rather, a contra- account is created to track all the depreciation recorded against the equipment. This contra-account, named Accumulated Depreciation, is like a negative asset account that is subtracted from the Equipment account in the assets section of the balance sheet, as shown in Exhibit 4.7.",0.0,-2.4287422

The graphs of 푦= 푥3 and 푦= 푥1∕3 are shown in Figure 1.48. Notice that these graphs are the reflections of one another across the line 푦= 푥.

The point labeled F2 is one of the foci of the ellipse; the other focus is occupied by the Sun. If we superimpose coordinate axes over this graph, then we can assign ordered pairs to each point on the ellipse (Figure 7.3). Then each x value on the graph is a value of position as a function of time, and each y value is also a value of position as a function of time. Therefore, each point on the graph corresponds to a value of Earth’s position as a function of time. Figure 7.3 Coordinate axes superimposed on the orbit of Earth. We can determine the functions for x(t) and y(t), thereby parameterizing the orbit of Earth around the Sun.

Solution To graph 푓, start at the point on the vertical axis specified by the initial condition and move with slope given by the value of 푓′ in Figure 6.5. Different initial conditions lead to different graphs for 푓, but for a given 푥-value they all have the same slope (because the value of 푓′ is the same for each). Thus, the different 푓curves are obtained from one another by a vertical shift.

Antelman wrote: The original inner circle of the Bund der Gerechten consisted of born Catholics, Protestants and Jews [Sabbatian-Frankist infiltrators], and those representatives of respective subdivisions formulated schemes for the ultimate destruction of their faiths. The heretical Catholics laid plans which they felt would take a century or more for the ultimate destruction of the church; the apostate Jews for the ultimate destruction of the Jewish religion.

State the THEOREM 2.,"Previously, we discussed the fact that if f(x) is continuous on ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦, then the limit lim n →∞∑ i = 1 n f ⎛ ⎝xi * ⎞ ⎠Δx exists and is unique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof. Theorem 1.1: Continuous Functions Are Integrable If f(x) is continuous on ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦, then f is integrable on ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦. Functions that are not continuous on ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For example, functions with a finite number of jump discontinuities on a closed interval are integrable. It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is not strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to define the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we must take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in our limits and makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with regular partitions for the Riemann sums. Example 1.7 Evaluating an Integral Using the Definition Use the definition of the definite integral to evaluate ∫ 0 2 x2 dx. Use a right-endpoint approximation to generate the Riemann sum. Solution We first want to set up a Riemann sum. Based on the limits of integration, we have a = 0 and b = 2. For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of [0, 2]. Then Δx = b −a n = 2 n. Since we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to calculate the function value at the right endpoint of the interval [xi −1, xi]. The right endpoint of the interval is xi, and since P is a regular partition, xi = x0 + iΔx = 0 + i⎡ ⎣2 n ⎤ ⎦= 2i n . Thus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is f(xi) = xi 2 = ⎛ ⎝2i n ⎞ ⎠ 2 = 4i2 n2 . Then the Riemann sum takes the form ∑ i = 1 n f(xi)Δx = ∑ i = 1 n ⎛ ⎝ 4i2 n2 ⎞ ⎠ 2 n = ∑ i = 1 n 8i2 n3 = 8 n3 ∑ i = 1 n i2.

Defense spending is increased. Fiscal Policy in the Dynamic Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply Model, pages 539–540 16.3 LEARNING OBJECTIVE: Use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model to analyze fiscal policy. Summary We can use the dynamic aggregate demand and aggregate supply model introduced in Chapter 13 to look more closely at expan- sionary and contractionary fiscal policies. The dynamic aggre- gate demand and aggregate supply model takes into account that (1) the economy experiences continuing inflation, with the price level rising every year, and (2) the economy experiences long-run growth, with the LRAS curve shifting to the right every year. In the dynamic model, an expansionary fiscal policy tries to ensure that the aggregate demand curve will shift far enough to the right to bring about macroeconomic equilibrium, with real GDP equal to potential GDP. A contractionary fiscal policy attempts to off- set movements in aggregate demand that would cause macroeco- nomic equilibrium to occur at a level of real GDP that is greater than potential real GDP.

Use the midpoint rule with n = 2 to estimate ∫ 1 21 xdx. The Trapezoidal Rule We can also approximate the value of a definite integral by using trapezoids rather than rectangles. In Figure 3.14, the area beneath the curve is approximated by trapezoids rather than by rectangles. Figure 3.14 Trapezoids may be used to approximate the area under a curve, hence approximating the definite integral. The trapezoidal rule for estimating definite integrals uses trapezoids rather than rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. To gain insight into the final form of the rule, consider the trapezoids shown in Figure 3.14. We assume that the length of each subinterval is given by Δx. First, recall that the area of a trapezoid with a height of h and bases of length b1 and b2 is given by Area = 1 2h(b1 + b2). We see that the first trapezoid has a height Δx and parallel bases of length f(x0) and f(x1). Thus, the area of the first trapezoid in Figure 3.14 is 1 2Δx(f(x0) + f(x1)). The areas of the remaining three trapezoids are 320 Chapter 3 | Techniques of Integration This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11965/1.2",0.0,-3.404251

What is the formula for this rule?,"Figure 4.80 If the initial guess x0 is too far from the root sought, it may lead to approximations that approach a different root. Example 4.48 When Newton’s Method Fails Consider the function f(x) = x3 −2x + 2. Let x0 = 0. Show that the sequence x1, x2 ,... fails to approach a root of f. Solution For f(x) = x3 −2x + 2, the derivative is f′(x) = 3x2 −2. Therefore, x1 = x0 −f(x0) f′(x0) = 0 −f(0) f′(0) = −2 −2 = 1. In the next step, x2 = x1 −f(x1) f′(x1) = 1 −f(1) f′(1) = 1 −1 1 = 0. Consequently, the numbers x0, x1, x2 ,... continue to bounce back and forth between 0 and 1 and never get closer to the root of f which is over the interval [−2, −1] (see Figure 4.81). Fortunately, if we choose an initial approximation x0 closer to the actual root, we can avoid this situation. 482 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",1.0,1.4428614

What is the formula for 4.4 FAMILIES OF FUNCTIONS AND MODELING?,"ulated Depreciation (assuming the company had no disposals).2 Decrease in Accounts Receivable Accounts Receivable increases when sales are made on account and it decreases when cash is collected from customers. An overall decrease in this account, then, implies sales on account were less than cash collections. To convert from the lower sales number that is included in net income to the higher cash collected from cus tomers, we add the difference ($9 million). Another way to remember whether to add or subtract the difference is to think about whether the overall change in the account balance is explained by a debit or credit. If the change in the account is explained by a credit, the adjustment in the cash flow schedule is reported like a corresponding debit to cash (added). In Dave & Buster’s case, the decrease in Increases Decreases If Accounts Receivable: Subtract (Sales Cash inflow) Add (Cash inflow Sales) > > 2Amortization and impairment losses (discussed in Chapter 9) would be handled in the same way as depreciation. Gains and losses on fixed asset disposals also would be dealt with in a similar manner, as discussed in Chapter Supplement 12A.

What is the definition of 2.5 The Precise Definition of a Limit?,"Economic Models 13 we know if the assumptions in a model are too simplified or too limiting? We discover this when we form hypotheses based on these assumptions and test these hypotheses using real-world information. Forming and Testing Hypotheses in Economic Models An economic variable is something measurable that can have different values, such as the incomes of doctors. A hypothesis in an economic model is a statement that may be either correct or incorrect about an economic variable. An example of a hy- pothesis in an economic model is the statement that the falling incomes earned by primary care physicians—often referred to as “family doctors”—will result in a de- cline in the number of physicians choosing to enter primary care in the United States in 2020. An economic hypothesis is usually about a causal relationship; in this case, the hypothesis states that lower incomes cause, or lead to, fewer doctors entering primary care. We have to test a hypothesis before we can accept it. To test a hypothesis, we ana- lyze statistics on the relevant economic variables. In our primary care doctor example, we would gather statistics on the incomes of primary care physicians, the number of primary care physicians, and perhaps other variables as well. Testing a hypothesis can be tricky. For example, showing that the number of primary care physicians declined at a time when the average income of these physicians declined would not be enough to demonstrate that the decline in income caused the decline in the number of physicians. Just because two things are correlated—that is, they happen at the same time—does not mean that one caused the other. For example, before entering practice, a doctor spends time in a teaching hospital as a resident in his or her field. Teaching hospitals deter- mine how many residencies they will offer in a particular field. Suppose that teaching hospitals decreased the number of residencies in primary care at the same time that the incomes of primary care physicians were declining. In that case, the declining number of residencies, rather than the declining incomes, might have caused the decline in the number of primary care physicians. Over a period of time, many economic variables change, which complicates the testing of hypotheses. In fact, when economists disagree about a hypothesis, such as the effect of falling incomes on the supply of primary care physicians, it is often because of disagreements over interpreting the statistical analysis used to test the hypothesis. Note that hypotheses must be statements that could, in principle, turn out to be in- correct. Statements such as “Increasing the number of primary care physicians is good” or “Increasing the number of primary care physicians is bad” are value judgments rather than hypotheses because it is not possible to disprove them. Economists accept and use an economic model if it leads to hypotheses that are confirmed by statistical analysis. In many cases, the acceptance is tentative, however, pending the gathering of new data or further statistical analysis. In fact, economists of- ten refer to a hypothesis having been “not rejected,” rather than having been “accepted,” by statistical analysis. But what if statistical analysis clearly rejects a hypothesis? For example, what if a model leads to a hypothesis that declining incomes of primary care physicians will lead to a decline in the number of these physicians, but the data reject this hypothesis? In this case, the model must be reconsidered. It may be that an as- sumption used in the model was too simplified or too limiting. For example, perhaps the model ignored the fact that primary care physicians were moving from owning their own practices to become salaried employees of hospitals, where they would be freed from the responsibilities involved in running their own businesses.",0.0,-2.7711136
State the 20.3 THE THREE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREMS.,"608 Chapter 19 Ideal Gases each other produce a scattering effect that causes the motion to be random and the distribu- tion of their speeds to become the Maxwell distribution speed very quickly, independently of any initial speed distribution given to them. How far do real gas molecules travel before they encounter another molecule? This distance is the mean free path, , of molecules in a gas. The mean free path is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas and the cross- sectional area of the molecule: ( ) k T r p = 2 4 . B 2 (19.31) Derivation 19.4 Mean Free Path To estimate the mean free path, we start with the geometric definition of the cross section for scattering. We assume that all the molecules in the gas are spheres with radius r. If two molecules touch, they will have an elastic collision, in which total momentum and total kinetic energy are conserved (see Chapter 7). Let’s imagine that a moving gas molecule encounters another gas molecule at rest, as shown in Figure 19.26a. The impact parameter b, as shown in Figure 19.26a, is the perpendicular distance between two lines connecting the centers of the two molecules and oriented parallel to the direction of the velocity of the moving molecule. The moving molecule will collide with the stationary molecule if b ≤ 2r. Thus, the cross section for scattering is given by a circle with area A r r = 2 = 4 , 2 2   ( ) as illustrated in Figure 19.26b. In a time period t, molecules with the average speed v will sweep out a volume V A vt r vt r vt = = 4 = 4 , 2 2   ( ) ( ) ( ) as shown in Figure 19.26c. Thus, the mean free path, , is the distance the molecule travels di- vided by the number of molecules it will collide with in that distance. The number of molecules that the molecule will encounter is just the volume swept out times the number of molecules per unit volume, nV. The mean free path is then vt Vn vt r vt n r n = = 4 = 1 4 . V V V 2 2 ( ) ( ) This result needs to be modified because we assumed that one moving molecule was incident on a stationary molecule. In an ideal gas, all the molecules are moving, so we must use the average relative velocity, vrel, between the molecules rather than the average velocity of the molecules. It can be shown that vrel = v 2; so the volume swept out by the molecules changes to V = 4r2vrelt = 4r2v t 2 . Thus, the expression for the mean free path becomes r n = 1 2 4 . V 2 ( ) For diffuse gases, we can replace the number of molecules per unit volume with the ideal gas value, using equation 19.8: n N V p k T = = .

Two types of strong acids, with examples you should memorize, are 1. The hydrohalic acids HCl, HBr, and HI 2. Oxoacids in which the number of O atoms exceeds the number of ionizable protons by two or more, such as HNO3, H2SO4, and HClO4; for example, in the case of H2SO4, 4 O’s 2 2 H’s 5 2 • Weak acids. There are many more weak acids than strong ones. Four types are 1. The hydrohalic acid HF 2. Acids in which H is not bonded to O or to a halogen, such as HCN and H2S 3. Oxoacids in which the number of O atoms equals or exceeds the number of ionizable protons by one, such as HClO, HNO2, and H3PO4 4. Carboxylic acids (general formula RCOOH, with the ionizable proton shown in red), such as CH3COOH and C6H5COOH • Strong bases. Water-soluble compounds containing O22 or OH2 ions are strong bases. The cations are usually those of the most active metals: 1. M2O or MOH, where M 5 Group 1A(1) metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) 2. MO or M(OH)2, where M 5 Group 2A(2) metal (Ca, Sr, Ba) [MgO and Mg(OH)2 are only slightly soluble in water, but the portion that dissolves dissociates completely.] • Weak bases. Many compounds with an electron-rich nitrogen atom are weak bases (none is an Arrhenius base). The common structural feature is an N atom with a lone electron pair (shown in blue): 1. Ammonia (N P H3) 2. Amines (general formula RN P H2, R2N P H, or R3N P ), such as CH3CH2N P H2, (CH3)2N P H, and (C3H7)3N P Summary of Section 18.1 • In aqueous solution, water binds the proton released from an acid to form a hydrated species represented by H3O1(aq). • By the Arrhenius definition, acids contain H and yield H3O1 in water, bases contain OH and yield OH2 in water, and an acid-base reaction (neutralization) is the reaction of H1 and OH2 to form H2O.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Counting bit strings of length n with no two consecutive 0s. Remark: Many people have studied variations of the original Tower of Hanoi puzzle discussed Links in Example 2. Some variations use more pegs, some allow disks to be of the same size, and some restrict the types of allowable disk moves. One of the oldest and most interesting variations is the Reve’s puzzle,∗proposed in 1907 by Henry Dudeney in his book The Canterbury Puzzles. The Reve’s puzzle involves pilgrims challenged by the Reve to move a stack of cheese wheels of varying sizes from the first of four stools to another stool without ever placing a cheese wheel on one of smaller diameter. The Reve’s puzzle, expressed in terms of pegs and disks, follows the same rules as the Tower of Hanoi puzzle, except that four pegs are used. Similarly, we can gener- alize the Tower of Hanoi puzzle where there are p pegs, where p is an integer greater than three. You may find it surprising that no one has been able to establish the minimum number of moves required to solve the generalization of this puzzle for p pegs. (Note that there have been some published claims that this problem has been solved, but these are not accepted by experts.) How- ever, in 2014 Thierry Bousch showed that the minimum number of moves required when there are four pegs equals the number of moves used by an algorithm invented by Frame and Stewart in 1939.

What is the formula for this rule?,"358 5 / Induction and Recursion Solution: Let n be the number of matches in each pile. We will use strong induction to prove P(n), the statement that the second player can win when there are initially n matches in each pile. BASIS STEP: When n = 1, the first player has only one choice, removing one match from one of the piles, leaving a single pile with a single match, which the second player can remove to win the game. INDUCTIVE STEP: The inductive hypothesis is the statement that P(j) is true for all j with 1 ≤j ≤k, that is, the assumption that the second player can always win whenever there are j matches, where 1 ≤j ≤k in each of the two piles at the start of the game. We need to show that P(k + 1) is true, that is, that the second player can win when there are initially k + 1 matches in each pile, under the assumption that P(j) is true for j = 1, 2, ... , k. So suppose that there are k + 1 matches in each of the two piles at the start of the game and suppose that the first player removes r matches (1 ≤r ≤k) from one of the piles, leaving k + 1 −r matches in this pile. By removing the same number of matches from the other pile, the second player creates the situation where there are two piles each with k + 1 −r matches. Because 1 ≤k + 1 −r ≤k, we can now use the inductive hypothesis to conclude that the second player can always win. We complete the proof by noting that if the first player removes all k + 1 matches from one of the piles, the second player can win by removing all the remaining matches. ◂ Using the principle of mathematical induction, instead of strong induction, to prove the results in Examples 2 and 3 is difficult. However, as Example 4 shows, some results can be readily proved using either the principle of mathematical induction or strong induction.",0.0,-0.7967912

On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity – many had two or three. This is extraordinary enough when you consider the propaganda campaign to use Italy to terrify the world, but how can they even say twelve percent were genuine when the ‘virus’ has not been shown to exist, its ‘code’ is a computer program, and diagnosis comes from a test not testing for it?

Problem How close can a 5.00-MeV alpha particle get to a gold nucleus if the only interaction between them is the Coulomb force? Solution We can use a straightforward application of conservation of total mechanical energy. Far from the nucleus, the alpha particle has a kinetic energy of 5.00 MeV and a potential energy of zero. As it approaches the gold nucleus, more and more kinetic energy is converted into potential energy. At the point of closest approach, the alpha particle has zero kinetic energy, and all its initial kinetic energy has been converted to potential energy. The alpha particle has a charge of +2e and the gold nucleus has a charge of +79e, so the electrostatic potential energy between them is U r k e e r ke r ( )= (2 )(79 ) = 2(79). 2 This gives us the equation ke r 2(79) =5.00 MeV, 2 min which we need to solve for the minimum distance, rmin.

What is the formula for this rule?,"688 Chapter 22 Electric Fields and Gauss’s Law One example of a TPC is the STAR TPC of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York. The STAR TPC consists of a large cylinder filled with a gas (90% argon, 10% methane) that allows free electrons to move within it without being captured by the gas atoms or molecules. Figure 22.17 shows the results of a collision of two gold nuclei that occurred in the STAR TPC. In such a collision, thousands of charged particles are created that pass through the gas inside the TPC. As these charged particles pass through the gas, they ionize the atoms of the gas, releasing free electrons. A constant electric field of magnitude 13,500 N/C is applied between the center of the TPC and the caps on the ends of the cylinder, and the field exerts an electric force on the freed electrons. Because the electrons have a negative charge, the electric field exerts a force in the direction opposite to the electric field. The electrons attempt to accelerate in the direction of the electric force, but they interact with the electrons of the molecules of the gas and begin to drift toward the caps with a constant speed of 5 cm/s = 5 · 104 m/s ≈ 100,000 mph. Each end cap of the cylinder has 68,304 detectors that can measure the charge as a func- tion of the drift time of the electrons from the point where they were freed. Each detector has a specific (x,y) position. From measurements of the arrival time of the charge and the known drift speed of the electrons, the z-components of their positions can be calculated. Thus, the STAR TPC can produce a complete three-dimensional representation of the ionization track of each charged particle. These tracks are shown in Figure 22.17, where the colors represent the amount of ionization produced by each track.

Solved Problem 22.2 Electron Moving over a Charged Plate Problem An electron with a kinetic energy of 2.00 keV (1 eV = 1.602 · 10–19 J) is fired horizontally across a horizontally oriented charged conducting plate with a surface charge density of +4.00 · 10–6 C/m2. Taking the positive direction to be upward (away from the plate), what is the vertical deflection of the electron after it has traveled a horizontal distance of 4.00 cm? Solution T H I N K The initial velocity of the electron is horizontal. During its motion, the electron experiences a constant attractive force from the positively charged plate, which causes a constant acceleration downward. We can calculate the time it takes the electron to travel 4.00 cm in the horizontal direction and use this time to calculate the vertical deflection of the electron.

The following subsections discuss each decay mode in more detail. In all decays, the decaying nucleus is called the parent and the nucleus it decays into is the daughter. If the parent and daughter nuclei are different elements, the pro- cess is known as transmutation. Only those decays that obey the conservation laws, in particular those of energy, charge, and baryon number, are possible. Alpha Decay In an alpha decay ( decay), the nucleus emits an alpha particle, which is the nucleus of a helium atom, 2 4He.

Confirming Pages 100 C H A P TER 3 The Income Statement phi71385_ch03_096-149.indd 100 10/10/20 07:01 PM whenever a business uses up its resources to generate revenues during the period, it reports an expense, regardless of when the company pays for the resources. Expenses follow revenues in the body of the income statement. Some of Noodlecake’s typical expenses are listed in the income statement shown in Exhibit 3.2. Net Income Net income is calculated by subtracting expenses from revenues; it is a total, not an account like Sales Revenue or Rent Expense. Because it is a total, net income summarizes the overall impact of revenues and expenses in a single number. It is called a net loss if expenses are greater than revenues, and net income if revenues are greater than expenses. Net income indicates the amount by which stockholders’ equity increases as a result of a company’s prof- itable operations. For this reason, net income (or loss) is a closely watched measure of a company’s success. Exhibit 3.2 shows how revenues, expenses, and net income would be reported in Noodlecake’s income statement. Each account title describes the specific type of revenue or expense arising from the business’s particular operations. Noodlecake reports “Sales Revenue,” whereas Netflix reports “Movie Subscription Revenue.” The income statement in Exhibit 3.2 is for the month ended September 30, 2021. As it turns out, September 30, 2021, is a Thursday. There is nothing particularly special about this date—it’s just the last day of the month. By dividing the company’s long life into shorter chunks of time, Jordan applies the time period assumption. It allows him to measure and evaluate Noodlecake’s financial performance on a timely basis. If net income is low in the current month, Jordan will find out about it quickly and be able to take steps to become more profitable in the following month. Notice that the income statement reports the financial effects of business activities from just the current period. This is a key distinction between the income statement and the balance sheet. The revenues and expenses on an income statement report the financial impact of activities in just the current period, whereas items on a balance sheet will continue to have a financial impact beyond the end of the current period. Balance sheet accounts are considered permanent, whereas income statement accounts are considered temporary. Another way people describe this difference is the balance sheet takes stock of what exists at a point in time, whereas the income statement depicts a flow of what happened over a period of time.

Théseus was the only hero of whom Athens made significant political use. relatively minor judicial reforms like Ephialtés’ that increased the powers of the People’s law-courts caused a great deal of public excitement. The sources often depict Ephialtés as an associate of Periklés, the man with whom the achievements of classical Athens are most strongly associated. Whatever Periklés’ role in Ephialtés’ reforms or the attack on Kimon, it is certainly the case that in the 450s Periklés pursued three further constitutional reforms, al least two of which are linked to Ephialtés’ actions: the introduction of pay for juries; the abolition of the ban on men in the third rank of Solon’s wealth classes, zeugital, serving as archons; and the law requiring Athenian citizens in future to have a mother, as well as a father, who was an Athenian citizen. This last reform is the hardest to understand. Some have seen this as aimed at the Athenian élite, who were inclined to seek out wealthy women from other cities to be their brides. But since Athenian soldiers and archons were increasingly mingling with people from the Delian League, this ruling would surely affect the non-clites as well.",1.0,2.0993724

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 20?,"90 Chapter 2 KEY CONCEPT: THE DERIVATIVE Defining Instantaneous Velocity Using Limit Notation When we take smaller and smaller intervals, it turns out that the average velocities get closer and closer to 68 ft/sec. It seems natural, then, to define instantaneous velocity at the instant 푡= 1 to be 68 ft/sec. Its definition depends on our being convinced that smaller and smaller intervals give averages that come arbitrarily close to 68; that is, the average speed approaches 68 ft/sec as a limit. Notice how we have replaced the original difficulty of computing velocity at a point by a search for an argumentto convince ourselves that the average velocities approacha limit as the time intervals shrink in size. Showing that the limit is exactly 68 requires the definition of the limit given on page 64 in Section 1.7. To define instantaneous velocity at an arbitrary point 푡= 푎, we use the same method as for 푡= 1. On small intervals of size haround 푡= 푎, we calculate Average velocity = 푠(푎+ h) −푠(푎) h . The instantaneous velocity is the number that the average velocities approach as the intervals de- crease in size, that is, as hbecomes smaller. So we make the following definition: Let 푠(푡) be the position at time 푡. Then the instantaneous velocity at 푡= 푎is defined as Instantaneous velocity at 푡= 푎 = lim h→0 푠(푎+ h) −푠(푎) h . In words, the instantaneous velocity of an object at time 푡= 푎is given by the limit of the average velocity over an interval, as the interval shrinks around 푎. This limit refers to the number that the average velocities approach as the intervals shrink. To estimate the limit, we look at intervals of smaller and smaller, but never zero, length. Visualizing Velocity: Slope of Curve Now we visualize velocity using a graph of height as a function of time. The cornerstone of the idea is the fact that, on a very small scale, most functions look almost like straight lines. Imagine taking the graph of a function near a point and “zooming in” to get a close-up view. (See Figure 2.3.) The more we zoom in, the more the curve appears to be a straight line. We call the slope of this line the slope of the curve at the point.

Fundamentals of Financial Accounting responds by using carefully chosen focus companies that students recognize and engage with in their everyday lives. From tech start-ups to some of the world’s most familiar trademark brands, each chapter opens with an engaging scenario or story using a familiar company. The same focus company, such as Walmart, Cedar Fair, American Eagle, National Beverage, Under Armour, or General Mills, is used throughout the entire chapter so that students can see how the concepts and calculations apply to a real-world company they are already familiar with. Today’s students have grown up hearing about start-up culture, and many are entrepreneurially minded having seen the rise of Apple, Facebook, and the “gig economy.” The authors showcase accounting’s relevance by using Noodlecake Studios, a digital start-up, as the company profiled in Chapters 1–4. With this example, students see how a new small business uses accounting, from planning to evaluation of financial performance. Written in clear, understandable language . . . The multiple real-world examples, colorful and “clean” exhibits, as well as other illustrations enhance the student’s learning process by making the information relevant and understandable.

What is the formula for ICN3?,"3.18 ∫x2 + 3x + 1 x2 −4 dx = x + 11 4 ln|x −2| + 1 4ln|x + 2| + C. As we see in the next example, it may be possible to apply the technique of partial fraction decomposition to a nonrational function. The trick is to convert the nonrational function to a rational function through a substitution. Example 3.31 Applying Partial Fractions after a Substitution Evaluate ∫ cosx sin2 x −sinx dx. Solution Let’s begin by letting u = sinx. Consequently, du = cosxdx. After making these substitutions, we have ∫ cosx sin2 x −sinx dx = ∫ du u2 −u = ∫ du u(u −1). Applying partial fraction decomposition to 1/u(u −1) gives 1 u(u −1) = −1 u + 1 u −1. Thus, ∫ cosx sin2 x −sinx dx = −ln|u| + ln|u −1| + C = −ln|sinx| + ln|sinx −1| + C. Evaluate ∫ x + 1 (x + 3)(x −2)dx. Repeated Linear Factors For some applications, we need to integrate rational expressions that have denominators with repeated linear factors—that is, rational functions with at least one factor of the form (ax + b)n, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. If the denominator contains the repeated linear factor (ax + b)n, then the decomposition must contain A1 ax + b + A2 (ax + b)2 + ⋯+ An (ax + b)n.

Managers should continuously assess the potential for fraud and other risks that could prevent the company from achieving its objectives. 3. Control activities. Control activities include various work responsibilities and duties completed by employees to reduce risks to an acceptable level. We discuss these activities in detail in the next section of this chapter. 4. Information and communication. An effective internal control system generates and com municates information about activities affecting the organization to support sound decision making. 5. Monitoring activities. The internal control system is evaluated often to determine whether it is working as intended. Deficiencies should be communicated to those responsible for taking corrective action, including senior management and/or the board of directors. As shown in Exhibit 5.3, the control objectives and components apply to all levels of an organization. Although a chief financial officer and a cashier are assigned different responsi bilities, their work combines to achieve the same control objectives through the components of control shown below.

What is the formula for 11 Critical points:?,"The superior performance of depth-first branch-and-bound and truncated depth-first branch-and-bound on the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Prob- lem is primarily due to two factors. The first is the lower-bound cost function based on the assignment problem (AP). As observed in previous research [7] and in our own experiments, this cost function gives a superb estimation of the actual cost of the corresponding asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem tour. In our experiments on the random asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem with the elements of cost matrices indepen- dently and uniformly chosen from {O, 1,2, ... ,2 16 - 1}, the cost of the assignment problem is 99.090% of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem cost on average for 100-city instances, 99.816% for 500-city in- stances, and 99.916% for 1,000-city instances. A good lower-bound cost function can usually give rise to a strong branch-and-bound algorithm. This has also been observed on number partitioning using branch-and-bound with Karmarkar-Karp heuristic [77]. The second factor that leads to the superb performance of depth-first branch-and-bound is that the state space under branch-and-bound subtour elimination with the decomposition rules of [15] is a tree without duplicate nodes. A search tree without duplicates is typically very compacted, giving rise to a small total number of nodes in the space. In addition, a tree struc- ture can also significantly speed up depth-first branch-and-bound, since no duplicate or cycle detection, which consumes a substantial amount of computation, is required. 6.4.4 Summary Depth-first branch-and-bound (DFBnB) is not only a general technique for optimally solving difficult NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems, but can also be adapted to efficient anytime and approximation algorithms. In this paper, we studied depth-first branch-and-bound and truncated depth-first branch-and-bound, which is a depth-first branch-and-bound with an early termination, on the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Prob- lem (ATSP) of various structures and sizes. Specifically, we experimentally compared depth-first branch-and-bound and truncated depth-first branch- and-bound against the local search algorithm of [65], which is the best approximation algorithm for the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem so far. Our experimental results showed that depth-first branch-and-bound",0.0,-3.4276512

In view of this, it is striking that the boulé was made up in such a way as to prevent its members becoming real experts; presumably the Athenians did not want it to acquire political power independent of the ekk/ésia’s control.

What is the formula for 270 Chapter 8 • Electron Configuration and Chemical Periodicity?,"276 Chapter 9 Circular Motion Constant Angular Acceleration Chapter 2 discussed at some length the special case of constant acceleration. Under this assumption, we derived five equations that proved useful in solving all kinds of problems. For ease of reference, here are those five equations of linear motion with constant acceleration: ( ) ( ) ( ) i = ii = iii x x v t a t x x v t v x x x 0 0 1 2 2 0 + + + x x x x x x x x x v a t v v v v v a = iv = v = 0 1 2 0 2 0 2 2 + + + ( ) ( ) ( ) (x x – ). 0 Now we’ll take the same steps as in Chapter 2 to derive the equivalent equations for constant angular acceleration. We start with equation 9.14 and integrate, using the usual notation convention of 0 ≡ (t0) : ( ) ( ') ' ( ') ' ' ( t d dt t dt d t dt dt t t t t t = = = ⇒ ∫ ∫ 0 0 )– ( ) ( ) ( ') '. t t t dt t t 0 0 0 ⇒ +∫ = This relationship is the inverse of equation 9.14 and holds in general. If we assume the angu- lar acceleration, , is constant in time, we can evaluate the integral and obtain ( ) ' . t dt t t = = 0 0 0 + + ∫ (9.24) For convenience, we have set t0 = 0, just as we did in Chapter 2 at this juncture. Next, we use equation 9.8, expressing the angular velocity as the derivative of the angle with respect to time and with the notation 0 = (t = 0): ∫ ∫ ∫ ∫ + ⇒ + + + ⇒ + + ⇒ + + d t dt t t t t dt t dt dt t dt t t t ( ) = ( )= ( )= ( ') ' = ( ') ' = ' ' ' ( )= . t t t t 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 (9.25) Comparing equations 9.24 and 9.25 to equations (iii) and (i) for linear motion reveals that these two equations are the circular motion equivalents of the two kinematical equations for straight-line linear motion in one dimension. With the straightforward substitutions x→, vx→, and ax→, we can write five kinematical equations for circular motion under constant angular acceleration: ( ) ( ) ) i = ii = (iii = 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 + + + t t t + + + − t ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ). iv = v = 1 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 (9.26) Self-Test Opportunity 9.7 The derivation has been provided for two of these five kinematical equations for circular motion. Can you provide the derivation for the remaining equations?

State the THEOREM 2.,"Let G be a graph with adjacency matrix A with respect to the ordering v1, v2, ... , vn of the vertices of the graph (with directed or undirected edges, with multiple edges and loops al- lowed). The number of different paths of length r from vi to vj, where r is a positive integer, equals the (i, j)th entry of Ar. Proof: The theorem will be proved using mathematical induction. Let G be a graph with adja- cency matrix A (assuming an ordering v1, v2, ... , vn of the vertices of G). The number of paths from vi to vj of length 1 is the (i, j)th entry of A, because this entry is the number of edges from vi to vj. Assume that the (i, j)th entry of Ar is the number of different paths of length r from vi to vj. This is the inductive hypothesis. Because Ar+1 = ArA, the (i, j)th entry of Ar+1 equals bi1a1j + bi2a2j + ⋯+ binanj, where bik is the (i, k)th entry of Ar.

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 10?,"and detailed background in other works. Sabbatian-Frankism combines the names of two frauds posing as ‘Jewish’ men, Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), a rabbi, black magician and occultist who proclaimed he was the Jewish messiah; and Jacob Frank (1726-1791), the Polish ‘Jew’, black magician and occultist who said he was the reincarnation of ‘messiah’ Zevi and biblical patriarch Jacob. They worked across two centuries to establish the Sabbatian-Frankist cult that plays a major, indeed central, role in the manipulation of human society by the Global Cult which has its origins much further back in history than Sabbatai Zevi. I should emphasise two points here in response to the shrill voices that will scream ‘anti-Semitism’: (1) Sabbatian-Frankists are NOT Jewish and only pose as such to hide their cult behind a Jewish façade; and (2) my information about this cult has come from Jewish sources who have long realised that their society and community has been infiltrated and taken over by interloper Sabbatian-Frankists. Infiltration has been the foundation technique of Sabbatian-Frankism from its official origin in the 17th century. Zevi’s Sabbatian sect aĴracted a massive following described as the biggest messianic movement in Jewish history, spreading as far as Africa and Asia, and he promised a return for the Jews to the ‘Promised Land’ of Israel. Sabbatianism was not Judaism but an inversion of everything that mainstream Judaism stood for. So much so that this sinister cult would have a feast day when Judaism had a fast day and whatever was forbidden in Judaism the Sabbatians were encouraged and even commanded to do. This included incest and what would be today called Satanism. Members were forbidden to marry outside the sect and there was a system of keeping their children ignorant of what they were part of until they were old enough to be trusted not to unknowingly reveal anything to outsiders. The same system is employed to this day by the Global Cult in general which Sabbatian-Frankism has enormously influenced and now largely controls. Zevi and his Sabbatians suffered a setback with the intervention by the Sultan of the Islamic OĴoman Empire in the Middle East and what is now the Republic of Turkey where Zevi was located.

IFRS also requires compa nies to capitalize costs of developing intangible assets, such as prototypes for making new products or tools.

What is the formula for 14.6 THE CHAIN RULE?,"ON Ethics Resetting the Clock Earlier in this chapter, you saw that as customer balances get older, the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts should be increased. Because increases in the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts are accompanied by increases in Bad Debt Expense, the result of older customer accounts should be a decrease in net income. MCI (a company now owned by Verizon) employed a credit manager who knew about these accounting effects. To avoid reducing net income, he “reset the clock” on amounts owed by customers. He did so by mak ing loans to customers, who then used the money to pay off their account balances. By replacing old accounts receivable with new notes receivable, he avoided recording approximately $70 million in bad debts. His scheme didn’t last long, though. After the fraud was revealed, the credit manager spent several years in prison, and he has been working to pay off over $10 million in fines.

What is the formula for this rule?,"2.5 Let’s revisit Example 2.4, only this time let’s integrate with respect to y. Let R be the region depicted in Figure 2.10. Find the area of R by integrating with respect to y. Figure 2.10 The area of region R can be calculated using one integral only when the curves are treated as functions of y. Solution We must first express the graphs as functions of y. As we saw at the beginning of this section, the curve on the left can be represented by the function x = v(y) = y, and the curve on the right can be represented by the function x = u(y) = 2 −y. Now we have to determine the limits of integration. The region is bounded below by the x-axis, so the lower limit of integration is y = 0. The upper limit of integration is determined by the point where the two graphs intersect, which is the point (1, 1), so the upper limit of integration is y = 1. Thus, we have ⎡ ⎣c, d ⎤ ⎦= [0, 1]. Calculating the area of the region, we get A = ∫ c d ⎡ ⎣u(y) −v(y) ⎤ ⎦dy = ∫ 0 1 ⎡ ⎣ ⎛ ⎝2 −y ⎞ ⎠−y ⎤ ⎦dy = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢2y −y2 2 −2 3y3/2⎤ ⎦ ⎥|0 1 = 5 6. The area of the region is 5/6 units2.

What is the formula for this rule?,"2.22 For what values of x is f(x) = x + 1 x −5 continuous? Solution The rational function f(x) = x + 1 x −5 is continuous for every value of x except x = 5. For what values of x is f(x) = 3x4 −4x2 continuous? Types of Discontinuities As we have seen in Example 2.26 and Example 2.27, discontinuities take on several different appearances. We classify the types of discontinuities we have seen thus far as removable discontinuities, infinite discontinuities, or jump discontinuities. Intuitively, a removable discontinuity is a discontinuity for which there is a hole in the graph, a jump discontinuity is a noninfinite discontinuity for which the sections of the function do not meet up, and an infinite discontinuity is a discontinuity located at a vertical asymptote. Figure 2.37 illustrates the differences in these types of discontinuities. Although these terms provide a handy way of describing three common types of discontinuities, keep in mind that not all discontinuities fit neatly into these categories. Figure 2.37 Discontinuities are classified as (a) removable, (b) jump, or (c) infinite. These three discontinuities are formally defined as follows: Definition If f(x) is discontinuous at a, then 1. f has a removable discontinuity at a if lim x →af(x) exists. (Note: When we state that lim x →af(x) exists, we mean that lim x →af(x) = L, where L is a real number.) 2. f has a jump discontinuity at a if lim x →a−f(x) and lim x →a+ f(x) both exist, but lim x →a−f(x) ≠ lim x →a+ f(x). (Note: When we state that lim x →a−f(x) and lim x →a+ f(x) both exist, we mean that both are real-valued and that neither take on the values ±∞.) 3. f has an infinite discontinuity at a if lim x →a−f(x) = ±∞or lim x →a+ f(x) = ±∞. 186 Chapter 2 | Limits This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",1.0,-0.7469475
What is the formula for THE CHAIN RULE?,"The chain rule enables us to differentiate composite functions such as √ 푥2 + 1 or 푒−푥2. Before seeing a formula, let’s think about the derivative of a composite function in a practical situation. Intuition Behind the Chain Rule Imagine we are moving straight upward in a hot air balloon. Let 푦be our distance from the ground. The temperature, 퐻, is changing as a function of altitude, so 퐻= 푓(푦). How does our temperature change with time? The rate of change of our temperature is affected both by how fast the temperature is changing with altitude (about 16◦F per mile), and by how fast we are climbing (say 2 mph). Then our tempera- ture changes by 16◦for every mile we climb, and since we move 2 miles in an hour, our temperature changes by 16 ⋅2 = 32 degrees in an hour. Since temperature is a function of height, 퐻= 푓(푦), and height is a function of time, 푦= 푔(푡), we can think of temperature as a composite function of time, 퐻= 푓(푔(푡)), with 푓as the outside function and 푔as the inside function. The example suggests the following result, which turns out to be true: Rate of change of composite function = Rate of change of outside function × Rate of change of inside function The Derivative of a Composition of Functions We now obtain a formula for the chain rule. Suppose 푓(푔(푥)) is a composite function, with 푓being the outside function and 푔being the inside. Let us write 푧= 푔(푥) and 푦= 푓(푧), so 푦= 푓(푔(푥)). Then a small change in 푥, called Δ푥, generates a small change in 푧, called Δ푧. In turn, Δ푧generates a small change in 푦called Δ푦. Provided Δ푥and Δ푧are not zero, we can say: Δ푦 Δ푥= Δ푦 Δ푧⋅Δ푧 Δ푥. Since 푑푦 푑푥= lim Δ푥→0 Δ푦 Δ푥, this suggests that in the limit as Δ푥, Δ푦, and Δ푧get smaller and smaller, we have: The Chain Rule 푑푦 푑푥= 푑푦 푑푧⋅푑푧 푑푥. In other words: The rate of change of a composite function is the product of the rates of change of the outside and inside functions. Since 푑푦 푑푧= 푓′(푧) and 푑푧 푑푥= 푔′(푥), we can also write 푑 푑푥푓(푔(푥)) = 푓′(푧) ⋅푔′(푥).",1.0,6.657223
What is the formula for CH3CH2?,"Machines C omputers can perform many tasks. Given a task, two questions arise. The first is: Can it be carried out using a computer? Once we know that this first question has an affir- mative answer, we can ask the second question: How can the task be carried out? Models of computation are used to help answer these questions. We will study three types of structures used in models of computation, namely, grammars, finite-state machines, and Turing machines. Grammars are used to generate the words of a lan- guage and to determine whether a word is in a language. Formal languages, which are generated by grammars, provide models both for natural languages, such as English, and for programming languages, such as Pascal, Fortran, Prolog, C, and Java. In particular, grammars are extremely important in the construction and theory of compilers. The grammars that we will discuss were first used by the American linguist Noam Chomsky in the 1950s. Various types of finite-state machines are used in modeling. All finite-state machines have a set of states, including a starting state, an input alphabet, and a transition function that assigns a next state to every pair of a state and an input. The states of a finite-state machine give it limited memory capabilities. Some finite-state machines produce an output symbol for each transition; these machines can be used to model many kinds of machines, including vending machines, delay machines, binary adders, and language recognizers. We will also study finite- state machines that have no output but do have final states. Such machines are extensively used in language recognition. The strings that are recognized are those that take the starting state to a final state. The concepts of grammars and finite-state machines can be tied together. We will characterize those sets that are recognized by a finite-state machine and show that these are precisely the sets that are generated by a certain type of grammar. Finally, we will introduce the concept of a Turing machine. We will show how Turing machines can be used to recognize sets. We will also show how Turing machines can be used to compute number-theoretic functions. We will discuss the Church–Turing thesis, which states that every effective computation can be carried out using a Turing machine. We will explain how Turing machines can be used to study the difficulty of solving certain classes of problems. In particular, we will describe how Turing machines are used to classify problems as tractable versus intractable and solvable versus unsolvable. 13.1 Languages and Grammars 13.1.1 Introduction Words in the English language can be combined in various ways. The grammar of English tells us whether a combination of words is a valid sentence. For instance, the frog writes neatly is a valid sentence, because it is formed from a noun phrase, the frog, made up of the article the and the noun frog, followed by a verb phrase, writes neatly, made up of the verb writes and the adverb neatly. We do not care that this is a nonsensical statement, because we are concerned only with the syntax, or form, of the sentence, and not its semantics, or meaning. We also note that the combination of words swims quickly mathematics is not a valid sentence because it does not follow the rules of English grammar. The syntax of a natural language, that is, a spoken language, such as English, French, German, or Spanish, is extremely complicated. In fact, it does not seem possible to specify all the rules of syntax for a natural language. Research in the automatic translation of one language 885",0.0,-8.375801

For example, since cos 푢= 1 −푢2 2! + 푢4 4! + ⋯ and sin 푣= 푣−푣3 3! + ⋯, we can substitute 푢= 2푥+ 푦and 푣= 푥+ 푦and expand. We discard terms beyond the second (since we want the quadratic polynomial), getting cos(2푥+ 푦) = 1 −(2푥+ 푦)2 2! + (2푥+ 푦)4 4! + ⋯≈1 −1 2(4푥2 + 4푥푦+ 푦2) = 1 −2푥2 −2푥푦−1 2푦2 and sin(푥+ 푦) = (푥+ 푦) −(푥+ 푦)3 3! + ⋯≈푥+ 푦. Combining these results, we get cos(2푥+ 푦) + 3 sin(푥+ 푦) ≈1 −2푥2 −2푥푦−1 2푦2 + 3(푥+ 푦) = 1 + 3푥+ 3푦−2푥2 −2푥푦−1 2푦2.",0.0,-8.097626

What is the formula for HCN3?,"The Limits of Using Fiscal Policy to Stabilize the Economy 551 The Size of the Multiplier: A Key to Estimating the Effects of Fiscal Policy In preparing the values shown in Table 16.2, the CBO relied on estimates of the govern- ment purchases and tax multipliers. Economists have been debating the size of these multipliers for many years. When British economist John Maynard Keynes and his fol- lowers first developed the idea of spending and tax multipliers in the 1930s, they argued that the government purchases multiplier might be as large as 10. In that case, a $1 bil- lion increase in government purchases would increase real GDP by $10 billion. Later research by economists indicated that the government purchases multiplier was much smaller, perhaps less than 2. Estimating an exact number for the multiplier is difficult because over time, several factors can cause the aggregate demand and short-run aggregate supply curves to shift, leading to a change in equilibrium real GDP. It can be challenging to isolate the effect of an increase in government purchases on equilibrium GDP. In preparing their estimates of the effect of the stimulus package on GDP, Obama administration economists used prices dropped by more than one-third. Government debt soared by 86 percent. The increased government debt was partly the result of increased government spending, in- cluding spending to bail out failed financial institutions. But most of the increased debt was the result of government budget deficits resulting from sharp declines in tax rev- enues as incomes and profits fell as a result of the recession. (We discuss government budget deficits and government debt in the next section.) Economic Variable Average Change Average Duration of Change Number of Countries Unemployment rate 17 percentage points 4.8 years 14 Real GDP per capita 29.3% 1.9 years 14 Real stock prices 255.9% 3.4 years 22 Real house prices 235.5% 6 years 21 Real government debt 186% 3 years 13 The table above does not include data for the United States during the 2007–2009 recession because that recession was still under way when Reinhart and Rogoff were compiling their data. The table below shows some key indicators for the 2007–2009 U.S. recession compared with other U.S. recessions of the post–World War II period: Duration Decline in Real GDP Peak Unemployment Rate Average for postwar recessions 10.4 months 21.7% 7.6% Recession of 2007–2009 18 months 24.1% 10.1% Consistent with Reinhart and Rogoff’s findings that recessions following financial panics tend to be unusually severe, the 2007–2009 recession was the worst in the United States since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The recession lasted nearly twice as long as the average of earlier postwar recessions, GDP declined by more than twice the aver- age, and the peak unemployment rate was about one-third higher than the average. Because most people did not see the financial crisis coming, they also failed to an- ticipate the severity of the 2007–2009 recession. Note: In the second table, the duration of recessions is based on National Bureau of Economic Research business cycle dates, the decline in real GDP is measured as the simple percentage change from the quarter of the cyclical peak to the quarter of the cyclical trough, and the peak unemployment rate is the highest unemployment rate in any month following the cyclical peak.

What is the formula for ICN3?,"The ‘vaccine’ and guaranteed income are designed to be part of a global version of China’s social credit system which tracks behaviour 24/7 and awards or deletes ‘credits’ based on whether your behaviour is supported by the state or not.

In China tens of millions have been denied travel by air and train because of this. All the locations and activities denied to refusers by the ‘vaccine’ passports will be included in one big mass ban on doing almost anything for those that don’t bow their head to government. It’s beyond fascist and a new term is required to describe its extremes – I guess fascist technocracy will have to do. The way the Chinese system of technological – technocratic – control is sweeping the West can be seen in the Los Angeles school system and is planned to be expanded worldwide. Every child is required to have a ‘Covid’- tracking app scanned daily before they can enter the classroom. The so-called Daily Pass tracking system is produced by Gates’ MicrosoĞ which I’m sure will shock you rigid. The pass will be scanned using a barcode (one step from an inside-the-body barcode) and the information will include health checks, ‘Covid’ tests and vaccinations. Entry codes are for one specific building only and access will only be allowed if a student or teacher has a negative test with a test not testing for the ‘virus’, has no symptoms of anything alleged to be related to ‘Covid’ (symptoms from a range of other illness), and has a temperature under 100 degrees. No barcode, no entry, is planned to be the case for everywhere and not only schools. Kids are being psychologically prepared to accept this as ‘normal’ their whole life which is why what they can impose in schools is so important to the Cult and its gofers.

We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico. Consolidation and Presentation Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain amounts in prior fiscal years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation adopted in the current fiscal year. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. Fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017 include 52 weeks while fiscal 2018 includes 53 weeks. Use of Estimates We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are carried at fair market value and consist primarily of money market funds. Receivables The components of receivables, net, follow: Card receivables consist of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions. Rebate receivables represent amounts due from ven dors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related these receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018. Merchandise Inventories The substantial majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, as determined by a cost method. These merchandise inventories represent approximately 29% of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The valuation allowance for merchandise inventories valued under a cost method was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2018.",0.0,-6.1939096

What is the formula for PROBLEMS?,"The multiplicative identity element 1 in the set of real numbers is greater than the additive identity element 0. Proof: By the trichotomy law, either 0 = 1, 0 > 1, or 1 > 0. We know by the identity elements axiom that 0 ≠1. So, assume that 0 > 1. We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction. By the additive inverse law, 1 has an additive inverse −1 with 1 + (−1) = 0. The additive compatibility law tells us that 0 + (−1) > 1 + (−1) = 0; the additive identity law tells us that 0 + (−1) = −1. Consequently, −1 > 0, and by the multiplicative compatibility law, (−1) ⋅(−1) > (−1) ⋅0. By Theorem 5, the right-hand side of last inequality is 0. By the distributive law, (−1) ⋅(−1) + (−1) ⋅1 = (−1) ⋅(−1 + 1) = (−1) ⋅0 = 0. Hence, the left-hand side of this last inequality, (−1) ⋅ (−1), is the unique additive inverse of −1, so this side of the inequality equals 1. Consequently, this last inequality becomes 1 > 0, contradicting the trichotomy law because we had assumed that 0 > 1. Because we know that 0 ≠1 and that it is impossible for 0 > 1, by the trichotomy law, we conclude that 1 > 0. c ⃝Hulton-Deutsch/Hulton- Deutsch Collection/Corbis via Getty Images ARCHIMEDES (287 B.C.E.–212 B.C.E.) Archimedes was one of the greatest scientists and mathematicians of ancient times. He was born in Syracuse, a Greek city-state in Sicily. His father, Phidias, was an astronomer. Links Archimedes was educated in Alexandria, Egypt. After completing his studies, he returned to Syracuse, where he spent the rest of his life. Little is known about his personal life; we do not know whether he was ever married or had children. Archimedes was killed in 212 B.C.E. by a Roman soldier when the Romans overran Syracuse. Archimedes made many important discoveries in geometry. His method for computing the area under a curve was described two thousand years before his ideas were re-invented as part of integral calculus. Archimedes also developed a method for expressing large integers inexpressible by the usual Greek method. He discovered a method for computing the volume of a sphere, as well as of other solids, and he calcu- lated an approximation of π. Archimedes was also an accomplished engineer and inventor; his machine for pumping water, now called Archimedes’ screw, is still in use today. Perhaps his best known discovery is the principle of buoyancy, which tells us that an object submerged in liquid becomes lighter by an amount equal to the weight it displaces. Some histories tell us that Archimedes was an early streaker, running naked through the streets of Syracuse shouting “Eureka” (which means “I have found it”) when he made this discovery. He is also known for his clever use of machines that held offRoman forces sieging Syracuse for several years during the Second Punic War.",0.0,0.36322042

This calculated speed is equal to the measured speed of light. This equality means that all electromagnetic waves travel (in vacuum) at the speed of light and suggests that light is an electromagnetic wave. Equation 31.15 states E/B = c. Even though c is a very large number, equation 31.15 does not mean that the electric field magnitude is much larger than the magnetic field magnitude. In fact, electric and magnetic fields are measured in different units, so a direct comparison is not possible. The speed of light plays an important role in the theory of special relativity, which we’ll examine in Chapter 35. The speed of light is always the same in any reference frame. Thus, if you send an electromagnetic wave out in a specific direction, any observer, regardless of whether that observer is moving toward you or away from you or in another direction, will see that wave moving at the speed of light. This amazing result, along with the plausible postulate that the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers, leads to the theory of special relativity. The speed of light can be measured extremely precisely, much more precisely than the meter could be determined from the original reference standard. Therefore, the speed of light is now defined to be precisely c = m/s. 299 792 458 , , (31.21) The definition of the meter is now simply the distance that light can traverse in vacuum in a time interval of 1/299,792,458 s.",0.0,-6.9400277

What is the formula for this rule?,"165 2.4 Sequences and Summations 2.4.1 Introduction Sequences are ordered lists of elements, used in discrete mathematics in many ways. For ex- ample, they can be used to represent solutions to certain counting problems, as we will see in Chapter 8. They are also an important data structure in computer science. We will often need to work with sums of terms of sequences in our study of discrete mathematics. This section reviews the use of summation notation, basic properties of summations, and formulas for the sums of terms of some particular types of sequences. The terms of a sequence can be specified by providing a formula for each term of the se- quence. In this section we describe another way to specify the terms of a sequence using a recurrence relation, which expresses each term as a combination of the previous terms. We will introduce one method, known as iteration, for finding a closed formula for the terms of a se- quence specified via a recurrence relation. Identifying a sequence when the first few terms are provided is a useful skill when solving problems in discrete mathematics. We will provide some tips, including a useful tool on the Web, for doing so. 2.4.2 Sequences A sequence is a discrete structure used to represent an ordered list. For example, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 is a sequence with five terms and 1, 3, 9, 27, 81 , ... , 3n, ... is an infinite sequence. Definition 1 A sequence is a function from a subset of the set of integers (usually either the set {0, 1, 2, ...} or the set {1, 2, 3, ...}) to a set S. We use the notation an to denote the image of the integer n. We call an a term of the sequence. We use the notation {an} to describe the sequence. (Note that an represents an individual term of the sequence {an}. Be aware that the notation {an} for a sequence conflicts with the notation for a set. However, the context in which we use this notation will always make it clear when we are dealing with sets and when we are dealing with sequences. Moreover, although we have used the letter a in the notation for a sequence, other letters or expressions may be used depending on the sequence under consideration. That is, the choice of the letter a is arbitrary.) We describe sequences by listing the terms of the sequence in order of increasing subscripts.",0.0,-3.350014

State the THEOREM 2.,"The transitive closure of a relation R equals the connectivity relation R∗. Proof: Note that R∗contains R by definition. To show that R∗is the transitive closure of R we must also show that R∗is transitive and that R∗⊆S whenever S is a transitive relation that contains R. First, we show that R∗is transitive. If (a, b) ∈R∗and (b, c) ∈R∗, then there are paths from a to b and from b to c in R. We obtain a path from a to c by starting with the path from a to b and following it with the path from b to c. Hence, (a, c) ∈R∗. It follows that R∗is transitive. Now suppose that S is a transitive relation containing R. Because S is transitive, Sn also is transitive (the reader should verify this) and Sn ⊆S (by Theorem 1 of Section 9.1). Furthermore, because S∗= ∞ ⋃ k = 1 Sk and Sk ⊆S, it follows that S∗⊆S. Now note that if R ⊆S, then R∗⊆S∗, because any path in R is also a path in S. Consequently, R∗⊆S∗⊆S. Thus, any transitive relation that contains R must also contain R∗. Therefore, R∗is the transitive closure of R. Now that we know that the transitive closure equals the connectivity relation, we turn our attention to the problem of computing this relation. We do not need to examine arbitrarily long paths to determine whether there is a path between two vertices in a finite directed graph. As Lemma 1 shows, it is sufficient to examine paths containing no more than n edges, where n is the number of elements in the set.",1.0,2.3683965

What is the formula for 4.4 FAMILIES OF FUNCTIONS AND MODELING?,"It would be wrong to suggest that Facebook is an outlier in this critique. Google's model of operation can be argued to be constant real-time biopolitical exploitation. Hardt and Negri {2000: 24) have argued that the contemporary capitalism of which Google is a foundational part is based on a form of biopower Biopower is a concept used by the French scholar Michel Foucault, referring to the techniques used by states to subjugate and control subjects. Google's vision is one where the world is made completely knowable, controllable and predictable. Google are therefore proponents of an ideology that Evgeny Nlorozov (20131 5) calls ""technological solutionism"", Solutionism is a recasting of all complex social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimised - if only the right algorithms are in place Morozov argues that solutionism is a typical ideology of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and intellectuals who glorify digital media as being the solution to societal problems. Morozov explicitly criticises the likes of Eric Schmidt (Google) and Mark Zuckerberg {Facebook} as technological solutionists that ""impoverish and infantilize our public debate"" (Morozov, 2013: 43), Technological solutionlsm reimagines the individual and the social as part of the algorithms or systems of digital media, and therefore any problems arising at an individual or social level can be solved by these digital media, This notion clearly has roots in cybernetic theory and imagination, as well as exerting a form of biopower where individuals are subjugated under these systems in order to create new data subjects. Google can be seen as a control machine that aims at controlling people's perception Of reality and at transforming these perceptions into profits (Fuchs, 2015: 162). Scott Galloway 1201?) uses an analogy of God to describe the kind of power relationship that Google has to the mere mortal users of its services. The power desired by Google is the knowledge of not only what we do, but also what we want to do. Google's aim is to stockpile information and use that information to build artificial models of mind that can be used to predict action. As Galloway {2Cl1?} pictures it, Google ""knows that as we walk through the mall we lust for a pair of Tory Burch Jolie pumps or Bose CluietComfort headphones. He knows you have a thing for girls with tattoos"". The objective of the harvesting of personal information is not an individualised tracking of the whole population, Pg 3? If Google insinuates itself into the intimate lives of each and every person, then massive databases that make numerical sense can be assembled [The Invisible Committee, 2015) to create a kind of cybernetic governmentality. While such a governmentality operates in terms of a completely new logic compared to the pre-digital world, its subjects continue to think of themselves according to the old paradigm in a 'cultural lag' We probably continue to believe that our 'personal' data belong to us and that we're only exercising our 'individual freedom' by deciding to let Google and Meta or the police have access to them The result of this accommodation is that the mass surveillance of individuals in this model is mass self-surveillance (Fuchs, 2011). a by- product of mass self-communication that requires users' permanent input and activity to work.",0.0,-1.4815924

It is flexible enough to accommodate individual course needs and requirements. Topics can easily be added or deleted, or the order changed. Changes to the text in the Eighth Edition are in italics. In all chapters, problems were added and others updated. In total there are more than 300 new problems, with a particular emphasis on ones that are moderately difficult and computational. Chapter 1: A Library of Functions This chapter introduces all the elementary functions to be used in the book. Although the functions are probably familiar, the graphical, numerical, verbal, and modeling approach to them may be new. We introduce exponential functions at the earliest possible stage, since they are fundamental to the understanding of real-world processes. Section 1.7 now includes a wider variety of problems on calculating limits that can be solved using algebra or estimated using a graph. Chapter 2: Key Concept: The Derivative The purpose of this chapter is to give the student a practical understanding of the definition of the derivative and its interpretation as an instantaneous rate of change. The power rule is introduced; other rules are introduced in Chapter 3. Chapter 3: Short-Cuts to Differentiation The derivatives of all the functions in Chapter 1 are introduced, as well as the rules for differentiating products; quotients; and composite, inverse, hyperbolic, and implicitly defined functions. Chapter 4: Using the Derivative The aim of this chapter is to enable the student to use the derivative in solving problems, including optimization, graphing, rates, para- metric equations, and indeterminate forms. It is not necessary to cover all the sections in this chapter. More optimization problems in Economics have been added to Section 4.3, including average cost and trade-offproblems. To help students in better understanding related rates, more problems have been added in Section 4.6, where a rate needs to be calculated, but the equations and rates are given. Chapter 5: Key Concept: The Definite Integral The purpose of this chapter is to give the student a practical understanding of the definite integral as a limit of Riemann sums and to bring out the connection between the derivative and the definite integral in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Chapter 6: Constructing Antiderivatives This chapter focuses on going backward from a derivative to the original function, first graphically and numerically, then analytically. It introduces the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the concept of a differential equation. Chapter 7: Integration This chapter includes several techniques of integration, including substitution, parts, partial fractions, and trigonometric substitutions; others are included in the table of integrals. There are discussions of numerical methods and of improper integrals. Problems have been added in Sections 7.1, 7.2, and 7.6 to emphasis the form of different integrands. Chapter 8: Using the Definite Integral This chapter emphasizes the idea of subdividing a quantity to produce Riemann sums which, in the limit, yield a definite integral. It shows how the integral is used in geometry, physics, economics, and probability; polar coordinates are introduced. It is not necessary to cover all the sections in this chapter. Section 8.6 has been rewritten to introduce the ideas of present and future value using the predicted costs of climate change, with related problems. Chapter 9: Sequences and Series This chapter focuses on sequences, series of constants, and convergence. It includes the integral, ratio, comparison, limit comparison, and alternating series tests.",0.0,-8.212386

State the THEOREM 1.,"The halting problem is an unsolvable decision problem. That is, no Turing machine exists that, when given an encoding of a Turing machine T and its input string x as input, can determine whether T eventually halts when started with x written on its tape. The proof of Theorem 1 given in Section 3.1 for the informal definition of the halting problem still applies here. Other examples of unsolvable problems include: (i) the problem of determining whether two context-free grammars generate the same set of strings; (ii) the problem of determining whether a given set of tiles can be used with repetition allowed to cover the entire plane without overlap; and (iii) Hilbert’s Tenth Problem, which asks whether there are integer solutions to a given poly- nomial equation with integer coefficients. (This question occurs tenth on the influential list of 23 unsolved problems Hilbert posed in 1900. Hilbert envisioned that the work done to solve these problems would help further the progress of mathematics in the twentieth century. The unsolvability of Hilbert’s Tenth Problem was established in 1970 by Yuri Matiyasevich.)",1.0,3.8955345

What is the formula for I ICN3?,"In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc length as the distance you would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket is launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents a road, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination. We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of x, then we examine the same process for curves defined as functions of y. (The process is identical, with the roles of x and y reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc length can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination of this concept. Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x) In previous applications of integration, we required the function f(x) to be integrable, or at most continuous. However, for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for f(x). Here, we require f(x) to be differentiable, and furthermore we require its derivative, f′(x), to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.) Let f(x) be a smooth function defined over ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦. We want to calculate the length of the curve from the point ⎛ ⎝a, f(a) ⎞ ⎠ to the point ⎛ ⎝b, f(b) ⎞ ⎠. We start by using line segments to approximate the length of the curve. For i = 0, 1, 2,..., n, let P = {xi} be a regular partition of ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦. Then, for i = 1, 2,..., n, construct a line segment from the point ⎛ ⎝xi −1, f(xi −1)⎞ ⎠to the point ⎛ ⎝xi, f(xi)⎞ ⎠. Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments, we want our line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. Figure 6.37 depicts this construct for n = 5. Figure 6.37 We can approximate the length of a curve by adding line segments. To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the change in horizontal distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over each interval is given by Δx. The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use Δyi = f(xi) −f(xi −1) to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval [xi −1, xi], as shown in Figure 6.38. Note that some (or all) Δyi may be negative. Chapter 6 | Applications of Integration 675",0.0,-7.8986235

For these reasons there is a need for a procedure for simplifying sum-of-products expansions that can be mechanized. The Quine–McCluskey method is such a procedure. It can be used for Boolean functions in any number of variables. It was developed in the 1950s by W. V. Quine and E. J. McCluskey, Jr. Basically, the Quine–McCluskey method consists of two parts. The first part finds those terms that are candidates for inclusion in a minimal expansion as a Boolean sum of Boolean products. The second part determines which of these terms to actually use.

What is the formula for S-35?,"87 10g(.Bd) = O(d). This means that best-first search takes time linear in the search depth to expand a node for difficult problems. All linear-space algo- rithms, on the other hand, can be implemented on a stack; each operation is executed on the top of the stack, and takes constant time. Figure 5.2(a) shows one example on a binary random tree where the running time of best-first search increases faster than that of depth-first branch-and-bound. The zero edge costs were chosen with probability Po = ~, and nonzero edge costs were uniformly chosen from {I, 2, 3, ... ,216 -I}. Figure 5.2(b) illustrates the corresponding average time per node expansion for both best-first search and depth-first branch-and-bound, which confirms our analysis. Overall, whether or not best-first search runs faster than a linear-space algorithm depends on the problem complexity and its size, which determine the number of nodes generated, and the time for expanding a node and generating all its children. 5.2 Comparison on Practical Problems 5.2.1 Lookahead search on sliding-tile puzzles Given an initial and goal state of a sliding-tile puzzle, we are asked to find a sequence of moves that maps the initial state into the goal state. In a real-time setting, we may have to make a move with limited computation. One approach to this problem, called fixed-depth lookahead search [75], is to search from the current state to a fixed depth, then move to the child of the current state that contains the minimum-cost frontier node in its subtree, and take that child as the next current state. We compared depth-first branch-and-bound, iterative deepening, and re- cursive best-first search on lookahead search. In our experiments, the cost function used is f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the total number of moves made from the initial state to node n, and h(n) is the Manhattan distance from node n to the goal state. Our experiments show that iterative deepening expands slightly more nodes than recursive best-first search for lookahead search, as expected. Figure 5.3 compares depth-first branch-and- bound and recursive best-first search. The horizontal axis is the lookahead depth, and the vertical axis is the number of nodes expanded. The results were averaged over 200 initial states. The curves labeled by 8, 15, 24 and 99 are the results on eight, fifteen, twenty-four and ninety-nine puzzles, respectively. The results show that depth-first branch-and-bound performs slightly better than recursive best-first search on small puzzles, while recur- sive best-first search is superior to depth-first branch-and-bound on large ones. Unfortunately, the state space of sliding-tile puzzles is not a tree, but a graph with cycles. In addition, a shortest complete solution path in such a",0.0,-1.6433498
What is the formula for OY:4?,"580 Chapter 10 APPROXIMATING FUNCTIONS USING SERIES It appears that the approximations converge to the true value, cos(휋∕2) = 0, very rapidly. Now take a value of 푥somewhat farther away from 0, say 푥= 휋; then cos 휋= −1 and 푃2(휋) = 1 −(휋)2∕2! = −3.93480 ... 푃4(휋) = ⋯ = 0.12391 ... 푃6(휋) = ⋯ = −1.21135 ... 푃8(휋) = ⋯ = −0.97602 ... 푃10(휋) = ⋯ = −1.00183 ... 푃12(휋) = ⋯ = −0.99990 ... 푃14(휋) = ⋯ = −1.000004 ... . We see that the rate of convergence is somewhat slower; it takes a 14th-degree polynomial to approx- imate cos 휋as accurately as an 8th-degree polynomial approximates cos(휋∕2). If 푥were taken still farther away from 0, then we would need still more terms to obtain as accurate an approximation of cos 푥. Exercise 18 on page 546 uses the ratio test to show that the Taylor series for cos 푥converges for all values of 푥. To show that its sum is indeed cos 푥, we use Theorem 10.3. This justifies our writing the equality: cos 푥= 1 −푥2 2! + 푥4 4! −푥6 6! + 푥8 8! −⋯ for all 푥. Showing That the Taylor Series for cos 풙Converges to cos 풙 The Lagrange error bound in Theorem 10.3 allows us to see if the Taylor series for a function con- verges to that function.

What is the formula for 7.23 A Greek army might regard it as worthwhile to include large numbers of?,"Graphing Cost Curves 367 cost curve and average total cost curve at their minimum points. When marginal cost is less than either average variable cost or average total cost, it causes them to decrease. When marginal cost is above average variable cost or average total cost, it causes them to increase. Therefore, when marginal cost equals average variable cost or average total cost, they must be at their minimum points. 2. As output increases, average fixed cost gets smaller and smaller. This happens because in calculating average fixed cost, we are dividing something that gets larger and larger—output—into something that remains constant—fixed cost. Firms often refer to this process of lowering average fixed cost by selling more output as “spread- ing the overhead” (where “overhead” refers to fixed costs). 3. As output increases, the difference between average total cost and average variable cost decreases. This happens because the difference between average total cost and average variable cost is average fixed cost, which gets smaller as output increases. Figure 11.5 Costs at Jill Johnson’s Restaurant Jill’s costs of making pizzas are shown in the table and plotted in the graph. Notice three important facts about the graph: (1) The marginal cost (MC), average total cost (ATC), and average variable cost (AVC) curves are all U shaped, and the marginal cost curve intersects both the av- erage variable cost curve and average total cost curve at their minimum points. (2) As output increases, average fixed cost (AFC) gets smaller and smaller. (3) As output in- creases, the difference between average total cost and average variable cost decreases. Make sure you can explain why each of these three facts is true. You should spend time becoming familiar with this graph because it is one of the most important graphs in microeconomics. 0.50 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 4.50 5.00 5.50 6.00 6.50 $7.50 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Costs (dollars per pizza) Quantity of pizzas produced Marginal cost (MC) Average total cost (ATC) Average variable cost (AVC) Average fixed cost (AFC) Quantity of Workers 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 Quantity of Ovens 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Quantity of Pizzas 0 200 450 550 600 625 640 Cost of Ovens (fixed cost) $800 800 800 800 800 800 800 Cost of Workers (variable cost) $0 650 1,300 1,950 2,600 3,250 3,900 Total Cost of Pizzas $800 1,450 2,100 2,750 3,400 4,050 4,700 ATC $7.25 4.67 5.00 5.67 6.48 7.34 AFC $4.00 1.78 1.45 1.33 1.28 1.25 AVC $3.25 2.89 3.54 4.33 5.20 6.09 MC $3.25 2.60 6.50 13.00 26.00 43.33 7.00 1.00",0.0,-6.7141333

What is the formula for this rule?,"1262 Chapter 40 Nuclear Physics Figure 40.5 shows the isotopes for which lifetimes have been measured. Each square represents an isotope, and the color of the square indicates the isotope’s lifetime, according to the scale to the right of the plot. In general, lifetimes are longest for isotopes that are near the stable isotopes, with some lifetimes (shown in dark red) even exceeding the age of the universe (which is approxi- mately 4.3 · 1017 s). Moving away from the stable isotopes, lifetimes become rapidly shorter. Note in particular the very short lifetimes of all isotopes with neutron numbers around 130 and the longer lifetimes for those with larger neutron numbers and proton numbers around 90. These isotopes with longer lifetimes include the isotopes of the actinides, most notably thorium, uranium, and pluto- nium. Uranium has no stable isotopes, but the isotopes 235 92U and 238 92U have lifetimes of 700 million years and 4.5 billion years, respectively, and thus live long enough to be found in large quantities on Earth. The following discussion will help you understand the systematic trends of the observed lifetimes. Nuclear and Atomic Mass The masses of the proton and the neutron are known to great precision. The values of the mass and the mass-energy equivalent for the proton are m m c =1.672 621 637(83) 10 kg =1.503 277 359(75) 10 J =938.272 013(23) MeV p –27 p 2 –10 ⋅ ⋅ and the values for the neutron are m m c =1.674 927 211(84) 10 kg =1.505 349 505(75) 10 J =939.565 346(23) MeV. n –27 n 2 –10 ⋅ ⋅ The parentheses around the last two digits in these numbers indicate that the preceding two digits are uncertain by those amounts; this is a more concise notation for the standard use of ± to denote uncertainties. For example, the notation 1.672 621 637(83) is equivalent to 1.672 621 637 ± 0.000 000 083. The stated uncertainties in the proton and neutron masses mean that they are known to approximately 1 part in 10 million. Interestingly, what limits the precision of these masses is the accuracy to which Avogadro’s number (NA; see Chapter 13) is determined or, equivalently, to what precision the SI standard measure of the kilogram is known (Chapter 1). Mass measurements for nuclei also reach this precision, even if the isotopes in question live only a few seconds or even a fraction of a second. One way to achieve such a mass mea- surement is to trap a single ion of a given atom in an electromagnetic trap inside a magnetic field (Figure 40.6a) and then measure its cyclotron frequency  = qB/m ⇒ m = qB/ (see Chapter 27). Ion manipulation and storage are made possible by the electrode configura- tions shown in Figure 40.6b. The charge of an ion is known precisely, because it is an integer multiple of the electron charge, and frequencies can be measured to essentially arbitrary accuracy by simply counting cycles, so the limit of this type of mass measurement depends on the accuracy with which the strength of the magnetic field, B, can be measured.",1.0,-2.8763897

The order of node expansions of best-first search. panded tree, best-first search typically requires space that is exponential in the search depth, making it impractical for most applications. Further- more, in order to facilitate selecting nodes in an ascending order of their costs, nodes in the open list is typically maintained in a partial order in a priority queue, such as a heap. This order maintenance also requires addi- tional computation. Pseudocode of the algorithm for tree search is given in Table 2.1, where the list open is used to maintain current frontier nodes. The algorithm starts with BFS(root). Figure 2.3 illustrates how best-first search works on the tree of Figure 2.2, with the numbers beside the nodes being the order in which the nodes are expanded. A special case of best-first search is the A * algorithm [43], which uses a cost function f(n) = g(n) + h(n), where g(n) is the sum of the cost of the path from the initial state to the current node n, and h(n) is an estimated cost from node n to a goal node. An important feature of A * is that, for a given consistent heuristic estimate h, it expands the minimum number of nodes among all algorithms guaranteed to find an optimal goal, up to tie-breaking among nodes whose cost is equal to the optimal goal cost [26].",0.0,-1.4909987

(b) Find the total area between sin(푥2) and the 푥-axis for 0 ≤푥≤ √ 2휋. Solution (a) The integral is the area above the 푥-axis, 퐴1, minus the area below the 푥-axis, 퐴2. See Figure 5.32. Estimating the integral with a calculator gives ∫ √ 2휋 0 sin(푥2) 푑푥= 0.43. The graph of 푦= sin(푥2) crosses the 푥-axis where 푥2 = 휋, that is, at 푥= √ 휋. The next crossing is at 푥= √ 2휋. Breaking the integral into two parts and calculating each one separately gives ∫ √ 휋 0 sin(푥2) 푑푥= 0.89 and ∫ √ 2휋 √ 휋 sin(푥2) 푑푥= −0.46. So 퐴1 = 0.89 and 퐴2 = 0.46.

Save me syndrome Almost every aspect of what I have been exposing as the Cult agenda was on display in even the first days of ‘Biden’ with silencing of Pushbackers at the forefront of everything. A Renegade Mind will view the Trump years and QAnon in a very different light to their supporters and advocates as the dots are connected. The QAnon/Trump Psyop has given the Cult all it was looking for. We may not know how much, or liĴle, that Trump realised he was being used, but that’s a side issue. This pincer movement produced the desired outcome of dividing America and having Pushbackers isolated. To turn this around we have to look at new routes to empowerment which do not include handing our power to other people and groups through what I will call the ‘Save Me Syndrome’ – ‘I want someone else to do it so that I don’t have to’. We have seen this at work throughout human history and the QAnon/Trump Psyop is only the latest incarnation alongside all the others. Religion is an obvious expression of this when people look to a ‘god’ or priest to save them or tell them how to be saved and then there are ‘save me’ politicians like Trump. Politics is a diversion and not a ‘saviour’. It is a means to block positive change, not make it possible. Save Me Syndrome always comes with the same repeating theme of handing your power to whom or what you believe will save you while your real ‘saviour’ stares back from the mirror every morning. Renegade Minds are constantly vigilant in this regard and always asking the question ‘What can I do?’ rather than ‘What can someone else do for me?’ Gandhi was right when he said: ‘You must be the change you want to see in the world.’ We are indeed the people we have been waiting for.

What is the formula for 8.1 Applications of Recurrence Relations?,"539 37. Determine J(100), J(1000), and J(10,000) from your formula for J(n). Exercises 38–45 involve the Reve’s puzzle, the variation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with four pegs and n disks. Before presenting these exercises, we describe the Frame–Stewart al- gorithm for moving the disks from peg 1 to peg 4 so that no disk is ever on top of a smaller one. This algorithm, given the number of disks n as input, depends on a choice of an integer k with 1 ≤k ≤n. When there is only one disk, move it from peg 1 to peg 4 and stop. For n > 1, the algorithm pro- ceeds recursively, using these three steps. Recursively move the stack of the n −k smallest disks from peg 1 to peg 2, us- ing all four pegs. Next move the stack of the k largest disks from peg 1 to peg 4, using the three-peg algorithm from the Tower of Hanoi puzzle without using the peg holding the n −k smallest disks. Finally, recursively move the smallest n −k disks to peg 4, using all four pegs. Frame and Stewart showed that to produce the fewest moves using their algorithm, k should be chosen to be the smallest integer such that n does not exceed tk = k(k + 1)∕2, the kth triangu- lar number, that is, tk−1 < n ≤tk. The long-standing conjec- ture, known as Frame’s conjecture, that this algorithm uses the fewest number of moves required to solve the puzzle, was proved by Thierry Bousch in 2014. 38. Show that the Reve’s puzzle with three disks can be solved using five, and no fewer, moves. 39. Show that the Reve’s puzzle with four disks can be solved using nine, and no fewer, moves. 40.

Show that if R(n) is the number of moves used by the Frame–Stewart algorithm to solve the Reve’s puzzle with n disks, where k is chosen to be the smallest in- teger with n ≤k(k + 1)∕2, then R(n) satisfies the recur- rence relation R(n) = 2R(n −k) + 2k −1, with R(0) = 0 and R(1) = 1. ∗42.

State the THEOREM 4.,"Let m be a positive integer. The integers a and b are congruent modulo m if and only if there is an integer k such that a = b + km. Proof: If a ≡b (mod m), by the definition of congruence (Definition 3), we know that m ∣(a −b). This means that there is an integer k such that a −b = km, so that a = b + km. Conversely, if there is an integer k such that a = b + km, then km = a −b. Hence, m divides a −b, so that a ≡b (mod m). The set of all integers congruent to an integer a modulo m is called the congruence class of a modulo m. In Chapter 9 we will show that there are m pairwise disjoint equivalence classes modulo m and that the union of these equivalence classes is the set of integers. Theorem 5 shows that additions and multiplications preserve congruences.",1.0,2.912767

For instance, a letter or digit may Links be used more than once on a license plate. When a dozen donuts are selected, each variety can be chosen repeatedly. This contrasts with the counting problems discussed earlier in the chapter where we considered only permutations and combinations in which each item could be used at most once. In this section we will show how to solve counting problems where elements may be used more than once. Also, some counting problems involve indistinguishable elements. For instance, to count the number of ways the letters of the word SUCCESS can be rearranged, the placement of identical letters must be considered. This contrasts with the counting problems discussed earlier where all elements were considered distinguishable. In this section we will describe how to solve counting problems in which some elements are indistinguishable. Moreover, in this section we will explain how to solve another important class of count- ing problems, problems involving counting the ways distinguishable elements can be placed in",0.0,-5.5685425

What is the formula for this rule?,"Vshell = 2π f(xi * )⎛ ⎝ xi + xi −1 2 ⎞ ⎠Δx. Furthermore, xi + xi −1 2 is both the midpoint of the interval [xi −1, xi] and the average radius of the shell, and we can approximate this by xi * . We then have Vshell ≈2π f(xi * )xi * Δx. Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate (Figure 2.28). Figure 2.28 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate. In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and hence the back edge of the plate would be slightly longer than the front edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat plate of height f(xi * ), width 2πxi * , and thickness Δx (Figure 2.28). The volume of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get Vshell ≈f(xi * )⎛ ⎝2πxi * ⎞ ⎠Δx, which is the same formula we had before. To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all the shells and obtain V ≈∑ i = 1 n ⎛ ⎝2πxi * f(xi * )Δx⎞ ⎠. Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function 2πxf(x). Taking the limit as n →∞gives us V = lim n →∞∑ i = 1 n ⎛ ⎝2πxi * f(xi * )Δx⎞ ⎠= ∫ a b ⎛ ⎝2πxf(x) ⎞ ⎠dx. This leads to the following rule for the method of cylindrical shells. 158 Chapter 2 | Applications of Integration This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11965/1.2",1.0,0.20008129
What is the formula for this rule?,"4.8 Figure 4.12 Direction field for the differential equation y′ = (y −3)2(y2 + y −2). The equilibrium solutions are y = −2, y = 1, and y = 3. To classify each of the solutions, look at an arrow directly above or below each of these values. For example, at y = −2 the arrows directly below this solution point up, and the arrows directly above the solution point down. Therefore all initial conditions close to y = −2 approach y = −2, and the solution is stable. For the solution y = 1, all initial conditions above and below y = 1 are repelled (pushed away) from y = 1, so this solution is unstable. The solution y = 3 is semi-stable, because for initial conditions slightly greater than 3, the solution approaches infinity, and for initial conditions slightly less than 3, the solution approaches y = 1. Analysis It is possible to find the equilibrium solutions to the differential equation by setting the right-hand side equal to zero and solving for y. This approach gives the same equilibrium solutions as those we saw in the direction field. Create a direction field for the differential equation y′ = (x + 5)(y + 2)(y2 −4y + 4) and identify any equilibrium solutions. Classify each of the equilibrium solutions as stable, unstable, or semi-stable. Euler’s Method Consider the initial-value problem y′ = 2x −3, y(0) = 3. Integrating both sides of the differential equation gives y = x2 −3x + C, and solving for C yields the particular solution y = x2 −3x + 3.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Figure 2.24 The graphs of f(x) and g(x) are identical for all x ≠1. Their limits at 1 are equal. We see that lim x →1 x2 −1 x −1 = lim x →1 (x −1)(x + 1) x −1 = lim x →1(x + 1) = 2. The limit has the form lim x →a f(x) g(x), where lim x →af(x) = 0 and lim x →ag(x) = 0. (In this case, we say that f(x)/g(x) has the indeterminate form 0/0.) The following Problem-Solving Strategy provides a general outline for evaluating limits of this type. Problem-Solving Strategy: Calculating a Limit When f(x)/g(x) has the Indeterminate Form 0/0 1. First, we need to make sure that our function has the appropriate form and cannot be evaluated immediately using the limit laws. 2. We then need to find a function that is equal to h(x) = f(x)/g(x) for all x ≠a over some interval containing a. To do this, we may need to try one or more of the following steps: a. If f(x) and g(x) are polynomials, we should factor each function and cancel out any common factors. b. If the numerator or denominator contains a difference involving a square root, we should try multiplying the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the expression involving the square root. c. If f(x)/g(x) is a complex fraction, we begin by simplifying it. 3. Last, we apply the limit laws. The next examples demonstrate the use of this Problem-Solving Strategy. Example 2.17 illustrates the factor-and-cancel technique; Example 2.18 shows multiplying by a conjugate. In Example 2.19, we look at simplifying a complex fraction. 166 Chapter 2 | Limits This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",0.0,2.556152

That is, remove all edges (x, y) for which there is an element z ∈S such that x ≺z and z ≺x. Finally, arrange each edge so that its initial vertex is below its terminal vertex (as it is drawn on paper). Remove all the arrows on the directed edges, because all edges point “upward” toward their terminal vertex. These steps are well defined, and only a finite number of steps need to be carried out for a finite poset. When all the steps have been taken, the resulting diagram contains sufficient infor- mation to find the partial ordering, as we will explain later. The resulting diagram is called the Hasse diagram of (S, ≼), named after the twentieth-century German mathematician Helmut Hasse who made extensive use of them. Let (S, ≼) be a poset. We say that an element y ∈S covers an element x ∈S if x ≺ y and there is no element z ∈S such that x ≺z ≺y. The set of pairs (x, y) such that y covers x is called the covering relation of (S, ≼). From the description of the Hasse diagram of a poset, we see that the edges in the Hasse diagram of (S, ≼) are upwardly pointing edges cor- responding to the pairs in the covering relation of (S, ≼). Furthermore, we can recover a poset from its covering relation, because it is the reflexive transitive closure of its covering relation. (Exercise 31 asks for a proof of this fact.)

What is the formula for S-52?,"As noted in the previous section, financial statement analyses are not complete unless they lead to interpretations that help users understand and evaluate a company’s financial results. When interpreting analyses, your goals should be to understand what each analysis is telling you and then combine your findings into a coherent “story” that explains the results of the company’s business activities. We demonstrate how to do this, beginning with interpretations of each set of analyses shown in Exhibits 13.1–13.5 and later concluding with an overall sum mary of Lowe’s results. Trends Revealed in Horizontal Analyses Horizontal (trend) analysis of Lowe’s balance sheet in Exhibit 13.1 shows the company grew in fiscal 2019. Overall, total assets increased 14.4 percent. The financing for this growth came from debt. In fact, during fiscal 2019, Lowe’s total liabilities increased by 21.5 percent (whereas stockholders’ equity decreased by 45.9 percent). The notes to Lowe’s financial state ments explain that Lowe’s liabilities increased because it issued about $3.0 billion of new bonds; its stockholders’ equity decreased because it paid $1.6 billion in dividends and repur chased about $4.3 billion of its common shares that were immediately retired and returned to authorized and unissued status. Horizontal analysis of Lowe’s income statement in Exhibit 13.2 shows a 1.2 percent increase in Net Sales Revenue, a 1.7 percent increase in Cost of Sales, and a 12.0 percent decrease in Operating and Other Expenses in fiscal 2019. The company explains in the Man agement’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of its annual report that Lowe’s decided to close underperforming stores in the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 2018 and 2019. The reduction in number of Lowe’s stores caused a slight decrease in Net Sales Revenue and Cost of Sales, but in fiscal 2019 that was more than offset at its remaining stores by a greater number of customer transactions at a higher average ticket price. When Lowe’s decided to close its stores in fiscal 2018, it recorded significant impairment losses that year; of course, similar losses were not recorded in fiscal 2019, leading to a 12.0 percent decrease in Operating and Other Expenses. The final changes in Lowe’s fiscal 2019 expenses related to interest and income tax expenses, which increased as a direct result of carrying more debt and earning more income.

What is the formula for 11.3 Tree Traversal?,"5.16 Use the comparison test to determine if the series ∑ n = 1 ∞ n n3 + n + 1 converges or diverges. Limit Comparison Test The comparison test works nicely if we can find a comparable series satisfying the hypothesis of the test. However, sometimes finding an appropriate series can be difficult. Consider the series ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1 n2 −1 . It is natural to compare this series with the convergent series ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1 n2. However, this series does not satisfy the hypothesis necessary to use the comparison test because 1 n2 −1 > 1 n2 for all integers n ≥2. Although we could look for a different series with which to compare ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1/(n2 −1), instead we show how we can use the limit comparison test to compare ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1 n2 −1 and ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1 n2. Let us examine the idea behind the limit comparison test. Consider two series ∑ n = 1 ∞ an and ∑ n = 1 ∞ bn. with positive terms an and bn and evaluate lim n →∞ an bn. If lim n →∞ an bn = L ≠0, then, for n sufficiently large, an ≈Lbn. Therefore, either both series converge or both series diverge. For the series ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1/(n2 −1) and ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1/n2, we see that lim n →∞ 1/(n2 −1) 1/n2 = lim n →∞ n2 n2 −1 = 1. Since ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1/n2 converges, we conclude that ∑ n = 2 ∞ 1 n2 −1 converges. The limit comparison test can be used in two other cases. Suppose lim n →∞ an bn = 0. Chapter 5 | Sequences and Series 491",0.0,-4.2632074

How much is that? Including gov- ernment and private money, health care spending in 2020 will average $13,710 for every man, woman and child, says Medicare’s Office of the Actuary. By comparison, U.S. health care spending this year is projected to top $2.7 trillion, or about $8,650 per cap- ita, roughly $1 of $6 in the economy. Most of that spending is for care for the sickest people. The report from Medicare econo- mists and statisticians is an annual ba- rometer of a trend that many experts say is unsustainable but doesn’t seem to be slowing down. A political com- promise over the nation’s debt and deficits might succeed in tapping the brakes on health care, but polarized lawmakers have been unable to de- liver a deal.

What is the formula for this rule?,"With a reasonable understanding of the basic fermionic building blocks of matter and their interactions via the exchange of fundamental bosons, we can begin to try to understand how they form composite particles. All composite particles formed by quarks are called hadrons. Hadrons are either quark-antiquark pairs, called mesons, or groups of three quarks, called baryons. Each quark has another trait that can be one of three values. As mentioned in Section 39.3, this trait is arbitrarily called color, even though it has nothing to do with the common use of the word as a visual property. All composite particles are color singlets. What is a color singlet? Quarks carry something called a color charge, coming in three varieties: red (r), green (g), and blue (b). Antiquarks carry anti-colors, which are marked with horizontal bars above the letters.

What is the formula for II I?,"A mesh network for 16 processors. processors, a processor cannot be linked directly to all others. For example, when there are 64 processors, C(64, 2) = 2016 connections would be required, and each processor would have to be directly connected to 63 others. On the other hand, perhaps the simplest way to interconnect n processors is to use an ar- rangement known as a linear array. Each processor Pi, other than P1 and Pn, is connected to its neighbors Pi−1 and Pi+1 via a two-way link. P1 is connected only to P2, and Pn is connected only to Pn−1. The linear array for six processors is shown in Figure 12. The advantage of a linear array is that each processor has at most two direct connections to other processors. The disadvantage is that it is sometimes necessary to use a large number of intermediate links, called hops, for processors to share information. The mesh network (or two-dimensional array) is a commonly used interconnection net- work. In such a network, the number of processors is a perfect square, say n = m2. The n proces- sors are labeled P(i, j), 0 ≤i ≤m −1, 0 ≤j ≤m −1. Two-way links connect processor P(i, j) with its four neighbors, processors P(i ± 1, j) and P(i, j ± 1), as long as these are processors in the mesh. (Note that four processors, on the corners of the mesh, have only two adjacent pro- cessors, and other processors on the boundaries have only three neighbors. Sometimes a variant of a mesh network in which every processor has exactly four connections is used; see Exercise 74.) The mesh network limits the number of links for each processor. Communication between some pairs of processors requires O( √ n) = O(m) intermediate links. (See Exercise 75.) The graph representing the mesh network for 16 processors is shown in Figure 13. One important type of interconnection network is the hypercube. For such a network, the number of processors is a power of 2, n = 2m. The n processors are labeled P0, P1, ... , Pn−1. Each processor has two-way connections to m other processors. Processor Pi is linked to the processors with indices whose binary representations differ from the binary representation of i in exactly one bit. The hypercube network balances the number of direct connections for each processor and the number of intermediate connections required so that processors can communicate. Many computers have been built using a hypercube network, and many paral- lel algorithms have been devised that use a hypercube network. The graph Qm, the m-cube, represents the hypercube network with n = 2m processors. Figure 14 displays the hypercube network for eight processors. (Figure 14 displays a different way to draw Q3 than was shown in Figure 6.) ◂ 10.2.7 New Graphs from Old Sometimes we need only part of a graph to solve a problem.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Figure 6.38 A representative line segment approximates the curve over the interval [xi −1, xi]. By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is (Δx)2 + ⎛ ⎝Δyi ⎞ ⎠2. We can also write this as Δx 1 + ⎛ ⎝ ⎛ ⎝Δyi ⎞ ⎠/(Δx)⎞ ⎠2. Now, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a point xi * ∈[xi −1, xi] such that f′(xi * ) = ⎛ ⎝Δyi ⎞ ⎠/(Δx). Then the length of the line segment is given by Δx 1 + ⎡ ⎣f′(xi * )⎤ ⎦2. Adding up the lengths of all the line segments, we get Arc Length ≈∑ i = 1 n 1 + ⎡ ⎣f′(xi * )⎤ ⎦2 Δx. This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as n →∞, we have Arc Length = lim n →∞∑ i = 1 n 1 + ⎡ ⎣f′(xi * )⎤ ⎦2 Δx = ∫ a b 1 + ⎡ ⎣f′(x) ⎤ ⎦2 dx. We summarize these findings in the following theorem. Theorem 6.4: Arc Length for y = f(x) Let f(x) be a smooth function over the interval ⎡ ⎣a, b ⎤ ⎦. Then the arc length of the portion of the graph of f(x) from the point ⎛ ⎝a, f(a) ⎞ ⎠to the point ⎛ ⎝b, f(b) ⎞ ⎠is given by (6.7) Arc Length = ∫ a b 1 + ⎡ ⎣f′(x) ⎤ ⎦2 dx.

What is the definition of 5.3 Recursive Definitions and Structural Induction?,"369 Proof: Recall that when the Euclidean algorithm is applied to find gcd(a, b) with a ≥b, this sequence of equations (where a = r0 and b = r1) is obtained. r0 = r1q1 + r2 0 ≤r2 < r1, r1 = r2q2 + r3 0 ≤r3 < r2, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ rn−2 = rn−1qn−1 + rn 0 ≤rn < rn−1, rn−1 = rnqn. Here n divisions have been used to find rn = gcd(a, b). Note that the quotients q1, q2, ... , qn−1 are all at least 1. Moreover, qn ≥2, because rn < rn−1. This implies that rn ≥1 = f2, rn−1 ≥2rn ≥2f2 = f3, rn−2 ≥rn−1 + rn ≥f3 + f2 = f4, ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ r2 ≥r3 + r4 ≥fn−1 + fn−2 = fn, b = r1 ≥r2 + r3 ≥fn + fn−1 = fn+1. It follows that if n divisions are used by the Euclidean algorithm to find gcd(a, b) with a ≥b, then b ≥fn+1. By Example 4 we know that fn+1 > αn−1 for n > 2, where α= (1 + √ 5)∕2. Therefore, it follows that b > αn−1. Furthermore, because log10 α≈0.208 > 1∕5, we see that log10 b > (n −1) log10 α> (n −1)∕5. Hence, n −1 < 5 ⋅log10 b. Now suppose that b has k decimal digits. Then b < 10k and log10 b < k. It follows that n −1 < 5k, and because k is an integer, it follows that n ≤5k. This finishes the proof. Because the number of decimal digits in b, which equals ⌊log10 b⌋+ 1, is less than or equal to log10 b + 1, Theorem 1 tells us that the number of divisions required to find gcd(a, b) with c ⃝Mondadori Portfolio/ Hulton Fine Art Collection/Getty Images FIBONACCI (1170–1250) Fibonacci (short for filius Bonacci, or “son of Bonacci”) was also known as Links Leonardo of Pisa.

At STP, 22 L of Cl2 gas contains about 1 mol, so a 5-L volume will contain a bit less than 0.25 mol of Cl2. Moreover, since P (in numerator) is slightly lower than STP, and T (in denominator) is slightly higher than STP, these values should lower the calculated n further below the ideal value.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Figure 2.30 The sine and tangent functions are shown as lines on the unit circle. By dividing by sinθ in all parts of the inequality, we obtain 1 < θ sinθ < 1 cosθ. Equivalently, we have 1 > sinθ θ > cosθ. Since lim θ →0+ 1 = 1 = lim θ →0+ cosθ, we conclude that lim θ →0+ sinθ θ = 1. By applying a manipulation similar to that used in demonstrating that lim θ →0−sinθ = 0, we can show that lim θ →0−sinθ θ = 1. Thus, (2.18) lim θ →0 sinθ θ = 1. In Example 2.25 we use this limit to establish lim θ →0 1 −cosθ θ = 0. This limit also proves useful in later chapters.

What is the formula for 7.6 IMPROPER INTEGRALS?,"Series Converging to π and 1/π Dozens of series exist that converge to π or an algebraic expression containing π. Here we look at several examples and compare their rates of convergence. By rate of convergence, we mean the number of terms necessary for a partial sum to be within a certain amount of the actual value. The series representations of π in the first two examples can be explained using Maclaurin series, which are discussed in the next chapter. The third example relies on material beyond the scope of this text. 1. The series π = 4 ∑ n = 1 ∞ (−1)n + 1 2n −1 = 4 −4 3 + 4 5 −4 7 + 4 9 −⋯ was discovered by Gregory and Leibniz in the late 1600s.

What is the formula for 20.1 The efficiency is given by?,"absence of a time lag: 1.  Presence of a threshold frequency. For current to flow, the light shining on the metal must have a minimum, or threshold, frequency, and different metals have different minimum frequencies. But the wave theory associates the energy of light with its amplitude (intensity), not its frequency (color). Thus, the theory predicts that an electron would break free when it absorbed enough energy from light of any color. 2.  Absence of a time lag. Current flows the moment light of the minimum frequency shines on the metal, regardless of the light’s intensity. But the wave theory pre- dicts that with dim light there would be a time lag before the current flows, be- cause the electrons would have to absorb enough energy to break free. • Explanation: the photon theory. Building on Planck’s ideas, Albert Einstein proposed in 1905 that light itself is particulate, quantized into tiny “bundles” of energy, later called photons.

What is the formula for this rule?,"The permutation 23415 of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} precedes the permutation 23514, because these permutations agree in the first two positions, but the number in the third position in the first permutation, 4, is smaller than the number in the third position in the second permutation, 5. Similarly, the permutation 41532 precedes 52143. ◂ An algorithm for generating the permutations of {1, 2, ... , n} can be based on a proce- dure that constructs the next permutation in lexicographic order following a given permutation a1a2 ⋯an. We will show how this can be done. First, suppose that an−1 < an. Interchange an−1 and an to obtain a larger permutation. No other permutation is both larger than the original per- mutation and smaller than the permutation obtained by interchanging an−1 and an. For instance, the next larger permutation after 234156 is 234165. On the other hand, if an−1 > an, then a larger permutation cannot be obtained by interchanging these last two terms in the permutation. Look at the last three integers in the permutation. If an−2 < an−1, then the last three integers in the permutation can be rearranged to obtain the next largest permutation. Put the smaller of the two integers an−1 and an that is greater than an−2 in position n −2. Then, place the remaining integer and an−2 into the last two positions in increasing order. For instance, the next larger permutation after 234165 is 234516. On the other hand, if an−2 > an−1 (and an−1 > an), then a larger permutation cannot be obtained by permuting the last three terms in the permutation. Based on these observations, a general method can be described for producing the next larger permutation in increasing order following a given permutation a1a2 ⋯an. First, find the integers a j and a j+1 with a j < a j+1 and a j+1 > a j+2 > ⋯> an, that is, the last pair of adjacent integers in the permutation where the first integer in the pair is smaller than the second. Then, the next larger permutation in lexicographic order is ob- tained by putting in the jth position the least integer among a j+1, a j+2, ... , and an that is greater than a j and listing in increasing order the rest of the integers a j, aj+1, ... , an in positions j + 1 to n. It is easy to see that there is no other permutation larger than the permutation a1a2 ⋯an but smaller than the new permutation produced. (The verification of this fact is left as an exercise for the reader.)",0.0,-2.0084155

What is the formula for 160 Athenian society |?,"516 C H A P T E R 1 5 Monetary Policy the profitability of the firms issuing the stock. Stock market bubbles end when enough investors decide stocks are overvalued and begin to sell. Why would an investor be will- ing to pay more for a share of stock than would be justified by its underlying value? There are two main explanations: The investor may be caught up in the enthusiasm of the moment and, by failing to gather sufficient information, may overestimate the true value of the stock; or the investor may expect to profit from buying stock at inflated prices if the investor can sell the stock at an even higher price before the bubble bursts. The price of a house should reflect the value of the housing services the house provides. We can use the rents charged for comparable houses in an area to measure the value of housing services. By 2005, in some cities, the prices of houses had risen so much that monthly mortgage payments were far above the monthly rent on comparable houses. In addition, in some cities, there was an increase in the number of buyers who did not intend to live in the houses they purchased but were using them as investments. Like stock investors during a stock market bubble, these housing investors were expect- ing to make a profit by selling houses at higher prices than they had paid for them, and they were not concerned about whether the prices of the houses were above the value of the housing services provided. During 2006 and 2007, it became clear that the air was rapidly escaping from the housing bubble. Figure 15.12 shows new home sales for each month from January 2000 through August 2011. New home sales rose by 60 percent between January 2000 and July 2005 and then fell by 80 percent between July 2005 and May 2010; sales remained at low levels during the following year. Sales of existing homes followed a similar pat- tern. Prices of new and existing homes in most markets also began to decline beginning in 2006, and the inventory of unsold homes offered for sale soared. Some homebuyers began having trouble making their loan payments. When lenders foreclosed on some of these loans, the lenders sold the homes, causing housing prices to decline further. Subprime loans are loans granted to borrowers with flawed credit histories.

Also, antiderivatives of the sine and cosine are easy to guess. Since 푑 푑푥sin 푥= cos 푥 and 푑 푑푥cos 푥= −sin 푥, we get ∫cos 푥푑푥= sin 푥+ 퐶 and ∫sin 푥푑푥= −cos 푥+ 퐶. Example1 Find ∫(3푥+ 푥2) 푑푥. Solution We know that 푥2∕2 is an antiderivative of 푥and that 푥3∕3 is an antiderivative of 푥2, so we expect ∫(3푥+ 푥2) 푑푥= 3 ( 푥2 2 ) + 푥3 3 + 퐶. You should always check your antiderivatives by differentiation—it’s easy to do. Here 푑 푑푥 ( 3 2푥2 + 푥3 3 + 퐶 ) = 3 2 ⋅2푥+ 3푥2 3 = 3푥+ 푥2.

What is the formula for 4.6 Ca(OH)2(aq) 1 2HNO3(aq) -?,"658 Chapter 11 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS The 푺-푰-푹Model We apply one of the most commonly used models for an epidemic, called the 푆-퐼-푅model, to the boarding school flu example. The population of the school is divided into three groups: 푆= the number of susceptibles, the people who are not yet sick but who could become sick 퐼= the number of infecteds, the people who are currently sick 푅= the number of recovered, or removed, the people who have been sick and can no longer infect others or be reinfected. The number of susceptibles decreases with time as people become infected. We assume that the rate at which people become infected is proportional to the number of contacts between susceptible and infected people. We expect the number of contacts between the two groups to be proportional to both 푆and 퐼. (If 푆doubles, we expect the number of contacts to double; similarly, if 퐼doubles, we expect the number of contacts to double.)Thus we assume that the number of contacts is proportional to the product, 푆퐼. In other words, we assume that for some constant 푎> 0, 푑푆 푑푡= − ( Rate susceptibles get sick ) = −푎푆퐼. (The negative sign is used because 푆is decreasing.) The number of infecteds is changing in two ways: newly sick people are added to the infected group,and others are removed.The newly sick people are exactly those peopleleaving the susceptible group and so accrue at a rate of 푎푆퐼(with a positive sign this time). People leave the infected group either because they recover (or die), or because they are physically removed from the rest of the group and can no longer infect others. We assume that people are removed at a rate proportional to the number of sick, or 푏퐼, where 푏is a positive constant. Thus, 푑퐼 푑푡= Rate susceptibles get sick − Rate infecteds get removed = 푎푆퐼−푏퐼. Assuming that those who have recovered from the disease are no longer susceptible, the recov- ered group increases at the rate of 푏퐼, so 푑푅 푑푡= 푏퐼. We are assuming that having the flu confers immunity on a person, that is, that the person cannot get the flu again. (This is true for a given strain of flu, at least in the short run.) In analyzing the flu, we can use the fact that the total population 푆+ 퐼+ 푅is not changing. (The total population, the total number of boys in the school, did not change during the epidemic.) Thus, once we know 푆and 퐼, we can calculate 푅. So we restrict our attention to the two equations 푑푆 푑푡= −푎푆퐼 푑퐼 푑푡= 푎푆퐼−푏퐼.",0.0,-8.059493

What is the formula for this rule?,"3.35 Solution First recall that sin3 x = (sinx)3, so we can rewrite h(x) = sin3 x as h(x) = (sinx)3. Applying the power rule with g(x) = sinx, we obtain h′(x) = 3(sinx)2 cosx = 3sin2 xcosx. Example 3.50 Finding the Equation of a Tangent Line Find the equation of a line tangent to the graph of h(x) = 1 (3x −5)2 at x = 2. Solution Because we are finding an equation of a line, we need a point. The x-coordinate of the point is 2. To find the y-coordinate, substitute 2 into h(x). Since h(2) = 1 ⎛ ⎝3(2) −5 ⎞ ⎠2 = 1, the point is (2, 1). For the slope, we need h′(2). To find h′(x), first we rewrite h(x) = (3x −5)−2 and apply the power rule to obtain h′(x) = −2(3x −5)−3(3) = −6(3x −5)−3. By substituting, we have h′(2) = −6 ⎛ ⎝3(2) −5 ⎞ ⎠−3 = −6. Therefore, the line has equation y −1 = −6(x −2). Rewriting, the equation of the line is y = −6x + 13. Find the equation of the line tangent to the graph of f(x) = ⎛ ⎝x2 −2⎞ ⎠ 3 at x = −2. Combining the Chain Rule with Other Rules Now that we can combine the chain rule and the power rule, we examine how to combine the chain rule with the other rules we have learned. In particular, we can use it with the formulas for the derivatives of trigonometric functions or with the product rule.

It acted not only as the import-export centre for Athens but also as a clearing-house for goods passing to and from other states. Not unnaturally, Athens sought to tap this commerce for her own benefit. and one of the chief ways she did so was to levy a 2 per cent tax on the value of goods imported to, or exported from, Attiké. As with all Athenian taxes, the collection of this tax was sold off to the highest bidder. Bidders estimated what 2 per cent of the exports and imports amounted to, reckoned how efficiently they could manage to collect (‘farm’) the tax, and sought to buy the tax for something under the figure that resulted. The lower their bid, the greater the difference between what they col- lected and what they paid over to the state. Andokidés, in his speech On the Mysteries, manages to turn his own bid for the tax into an act of public service: Agyrrhios, that honest man you know well, had been for two years the chief farmer of the 2 per cent tax.

What is the formula for this rule?,"In Section 11.7 we modeled the growth of a single population over time. We now consider the growth of two populations that interact, such as a population of sick people infecting the healthy people around them. This involves not just one differential equation, but a system of two. Diseases and Epidemics Differential equations can be used to predict when an outbreak of a disease will become so severe that it is called an epidemic27 and to decide what level of vaccination is necessary to prevent an epidemic. Let’s consider a specific example. Flu in a British Boarding School In January 1978, 763 students returned to a boys’ boarding school after their winter vacation. A week later, one boy developed the flu, followed by two others the next day. By the end of the month, nearly half the boys were sick. Most of the school had been affected by the time the epidemic was over in mid-February.28 Being able to predict how many people will get sick, and when, is an important step toward con- trolling an epidemic. This is one of the responsibilities of Britain’s Communicable Disease Surveil- lance Centre and the US’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. 27Exactly when a disease should be called an epidemic is not always clear. The medical profession generally classifies a disease an epidemic when the frequency is higher than usually expected—leaving open the question of what is usually expected.

Buring (Boston: Little, Brown, 1987). 28Data from the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (UK); reported in “Influenza in a Boarding School,” British Medical Journal, March 4, 1978, and by J. D.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Answers to Odd-Numbered Exercises of n = 2k positive real numbers. Basis step: k = 1 and n = 21 = 2. Note that (√a1 −√a2)2 ≥0. Expanding this shows that a1 −2√a1a2 + a2 ≥0, that is, (a1 + a2)∕2 ≥(a1a2)1∕2. Inductive step: Assume that P(k) is true, with n = 2k. We will show that P(k + 1) is true. We have 2k+1 = 2n. Now (a1 + a2 + ⋯+ a2n)∕(2n) = [(a1 + a2 + ⋯+ an)∕n + (an+1 + an+2 + ⋯+ a2n)∕n]∕2 and similarly (a1a2 ⋯a2n)1∕(2n) = [(a1 ⋯an)1∕n(an+1 ⋯a2n)1∕n]1∕2. To simplify the notation, let A(x, y, ... ) and G(x, y, ... ) denote the arithmetic mean and geometric mean of x, y, ... , respectively. Also, if x ≤x′, y ≤y′, and so on, then A(x, y, ... ) ≤A(x′, y′, ... ) and G(x, y, ... ) ≤ G(x′, y′, ... ). Hence, A(a1, ... , a2n) = A(A(a1, ... , an), A(an+1, ... , a2n)) ≥ A(G(a1, ... , an), G(an+1, ... , a2n)) ≥G(G(a1, ... , an), G(an+1, ... , a2n)) = G(a1, ... , a2n). This finishes the proof for powers of 2. Now if n is not a power of 2, let m be the next higher power of 2, and let an+1, ... , am all equal A(a1, ... , an) = a. Then we have [(a1a2 ⋯an)am−n]1∕m ≤A(a1, ... , am), because m is a power of 2. Because A(a1, ... , am) = a, it follows that (a1 ⋯an)1∕ma1−n∕m ≤an∕m. Raising both sides to the (m∕n)th power gives G(a1, ... , an) ≤A(a1, ... , an). 65. Basis step: For n = 1, the left-hand side is just 1 1, which is 1. For n = 2, there are three nonempty subsets {1}, {2}, and {1, 2}, so the left-hand side is 1 1 + 1 2 + 1 1⋅2 = 2. Inductive step: Assume that the statement is true for k.",0.0,0.435546

What is the formula for this rule?,"890 13 / Modeling Computation Of the four types of grammars we have defined, context-sensitive grammars have the most complicated definition. Sometimes, these grammars are defined in a different way. A production of the form w1 →w2 is called noncontracting if the length of w1 is less than or equal to the length of w2. According to our characterization of context-senstive languages, every produc- tion in a type 1 grammar, other than the production S →λ, if it is present, is noncontracting. It follows that the lengths of the strings in a derivation in a context-sensitive language are non- decreasing unless the production S →λis used. This means that the only way for the empty string to belong to the language generated by a context-sensitive grammar is for the production S →λto be part of the grammar. The other way that context-sensitive grammars are defined is by specifying that all productions are noncontracting. A grammar with this property is called noncontracting or monotonic. The class of noncontracting grammars is not the same as the class of context-sensitive grammars. However, these two classes are closely related; it can be shown that they define the same set of languages except that noncontracting grammars cannot generate any language containing the empty string λ.",1.0,0.15392342

What is the formula for 5.1 Mathematical Induction?,"The Strongly Connected Components of the Web Graph The web graph introduced in Example 5 of Section 10.1 represents web pages with vertices, and links with directed edges. Determining the size of the web graph is a challenging problem because it is extraordinarily large. A snapshot of the web in 1999 produced a web graph with over 200 million vertices and Links over 1.5 billion edges. In 2010 the web graph was estimated to have at least 55 billion vertices In 2010 it was esti- mated that 40 terrabytes of computer mem- ory would be needed to represent the adja- cency matrix of the web graph, but the storage requirements today are vastly larger. and one trillion edges. From these limited data (and from what is readily apparent if you have used the web in recent years), the number of web pages has a rapid rate of growth. (See [Br00] and the web resources for details.) The underlying undirected graph of the web graph, as it existed in 1999, is not connected, but it has a connected component that includes approximately 90% of the vertices in the graph. The subgraph of the original directed graph corresponding to this connected component of the underlying undirected graph (that is, with the same vertices and all directed edges connecting vertices in this subgraph) has one very large strongly connected component and many small ones. The former is called the giant strongly connected component (GSCC) of the directed graph. A web page in this component can be reached following links starting at any other page in this component. The GSCC in the web graph was found to have over 53 million vertices. The remaining vertices in the large connected component of the undirected graph represent three different types of web pages: pages that can be reached from a page in the GSCC, but do not link back to these pages following a series of links; pages that link back to pages in the GSCC following a series of links, but cannot be reached by following links on pages in the GSCC; and pages that cannot reach pages in the GSCC and cannot be reached from pages in the GSCC following a series of links. Each of these three other sets was found to have approximately 44 million vertices. (It is rather surprising that these three sets are close to the same size.) ◂ 10.4.6 Paths and Isomorphism There are several ways that paths and circuits can help determine whether two graphs are iso- morphic. For example, the existence of a simple circuit of a particular length is a useful invariant that can be used to show that two graphs are not isomorphic. In addition, paths can be used to construct mappings that may be isomorphisms. As we mentioned, a useful isomorphic invariant for simple graphs is the existence of a simple circuit of length k, where k is a positive integer greater than 2. (The proof that this is an invariant is left as Exercise 60.) Example 13 illustrates how this invariant can be used to show that two graphs are not isomorphic.",0.0,-2.8479946

Find d dx ⎛ ⎝x4⎞ ⎠. As we shall see, the procedure for finding the derivative of the general form f(x) = xn is very similar. Although it is often unwise to draw general conclusions from specific examples, we note that when we differentiate f(x) = x3, the power on x becomes the coefficient of x2 in the derivative and the power on x in the derivative decreases by 1. The following theorem states that the power rule holds for all positive integer powers of x. We will eventually extend this result to negative integer powers. Later, we will see that this rule may also be extended first to rational powers of x and then to arbitrary powers of x. Be aware, however, that this rule does not apply to functions in which a constant is raised to a variable power, such as f(x) = 3x. Theorem 3.3: The Power Rule Let n be a positive integer. If f(x) = xn, then f′(x) = nxn −1. Alternatively, we may express this rule as d dxxn = nxn −1. Proof For f(x) = xn where n is a positive integer, we have f′(x) = lim h →0 (x + h)n −xn h . Since (x + h)n = xn + nxn −1 h + ⎛ ⎝ n 2 ⎞ ⎠xn −2 h2 + ⎛ ⎝ n 3 ⎞ ⎠xn −3 h3 + ... + nxhn −1 + hn, we see that Chapter 3 | Derivatives 251",0.0,-3.4230072

In addition to the temple of Athéné, a headquarters for the annually chosen military leaders (stratégoi, ‘generals’) is known to have been erected during the 440s and 430s. In the last thirty years of the fifth century, further colonnaded buildings were added on the west and south of the agora; the old bouleutérion was replaced and converted into a public records office; and the mint and a law-court were erected. Defeat in the Peloponnesian War (404) then halted further building, but activity recommenced in the middle of the fourth century with a new foun- tain-house. Temples to civic cults and a large altar to Zens Agoraios were also put up at this time; and a fenced pedestal on which stood statues of the ten tribal heroes of Attiké was used as a public notice-board in the agora for new proposed legislation, impending lawsuits and lists of men called up for military service. All this building work emphasises the increasingly democratic bias of Athens and the more extensive involvement of the citizens that it brought in its wake. However, despite the growing formalisation of the agord, the crafts- men of Athens — potters, sculptors, bronze-smiths — continued to live and work on and around the borders of the public area, and excavated remains of their workshops illustrate the variety of life in the city centre.

But, at a given tem- perature and pressure, the density of a substance is a characteristic physical property and, thus, has a specific value. The SI unit of density is kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3), but in chemistry, density has units of g/L (g/dm3) or g/mL (g/cm3) (Table 1.4).

Plan ​ We have to find the mass of cable (in kg) from the given mass/length of fiber (1.1931023 lb/m), number of fibers/cable (6), and length of cable (8.843103 km). Let’s first find the mass of one fiber and then the mass of cable. As shown in the road map, we convert the length of one fiber from km to m and then find its mass (in lb) by converting m to lb. Then we multiply the fiber mass by 6 to get the cable mass, and finally convert lb to kg. Solution ​ Converting the fiber length from km to m: Length (m) of fiber 5 8.843103 km 3 103 m 1 km 5 8.843106 m Converting the length of one fiber to mass (lb): Mass (lb) of fiber 5 8.843106 m 3 1.1931023 lb 1 m 5 1.053104 lb Finding the mass of the cable (lb): Mass (lb) of cable 5 1.053104 lb 1 fiber 3 6 fibers 1 cable 5 6.303104 lb/cable Converting the mass of the cable from lb to kg: Mass (kg) of cable 5 6.303104 lb 1 cable 3 1 kg 2.205 lb 5 2.863104 kg/cable Check ​ The units are correct. Let’s think through the relative sizes of the answers to see if they make sense: The number of m should be 103 larger than the number of km. If 1 m of fiber weighs about 1023 lb, about 107 m should weigh about 104 lb. The cable mass should be six times as much, or about 63104 lb. Since 1 lb is about 1 2 kg, the number of kg should be about half the number of lb.

State the THEOREM 3.,"768 Chapter 13 A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL: VECTORS Resolving a Vector into Components: Projections In Section 13.1, we resolved a vector into components parallel to the axes. Now we see how to resolve a vector, ⃗ 푣, into components, called ⃗ 푣parallel and ⃗ 푣perp, which are parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to a given nonzero vector, ⃗ 푢. (See Figure 13.31.) 휃 ⃗ 푢 ⃗ 푣 ⃗ 푣perp ⃗ 푣parallel (a) 휃 ⃗ 푣parallel ⃗ 푣 ⃗ 푢 ⃗ 푣perp (b) Figure 13.31: Resolving ⃗ 푣into components parallel and perpendicular to ⃗ 푢 (a) 0 < 휃< 휋∕2 (b) 휋∕2 < 휃< 휋 The projection of ⃗ 푣on ⃗ 푢, written ⃗ 푣parallel, measures (in some sense) how much the vector ⃗ 푣is aligned with the vector ⃗ 푢. The length of ⃗ 푣parallel is the length of the shadow cast by ⃗ 푣on a line in the direction of ⃗ 푢. To compute ⃗ 푣parallel, we assume ⃗ 푢is a unit vector. (If not, create one by dividing by its length.) Then Figure 13.31(a) shows that, if 0 ≤휃≤휋∕2: ‖⃗ 푣parallel‖ = ‖⃗ 푣‖ cos 휃= ⃗ 푣⋅⃗ 푢 (since ‖⃗ 푢‖ = 1). Now ⃗ 푣parallel is a scalar multiple of ⃗ 푢, and since ⃗ 푢is a unit vector, ⃗ 푣parallel = (‖⃗ 푣‖ cos 휃)⃗ 푢= (⃗ 푣⋅⃗ 푢)⃗ 푢. A similar argument shows that if 휋∕2 < 휃≤휋, as in Figure 13.31(b), this formula for ⃗ 푣parallel still holds. The vector ⃗ 푣perp is specified by ⃗ 푣perp = ⃗ 푣−⃗ 푣parallel.

State the 19.4 THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM.,"monumentally wrong? Ah, but it makes sense from the Cult point of view. These ‘experts’ keep on producing predictions that suit the Cult agenda for societal transformation and so it was with Neil Ferguson as he revealed his horrific (and clearly insane) computer model predictions that allowed lockdowns to be imposed in Britain, the United States and many other countries. Ferguson does not have even an A-level in biology and would appear to have no formal training in computer modelling, medicine or epidemiology, according to Derek Winton, an MSc in Computational Intelligence. He wrote an article somewhat aghast at what Ferguson did which included taking no account of respiratory disease ‘seasonality’ which means it is far worse in the winter months. Who would have thought that respiratory disease could be worse in the winter? Well, certainly not Ferguson. The massively China-connected Imperial College and its bizarre professor provided the excuse for the long-incubated Chinese model of human control to travel westward at lightning speed. Imperial College confirms on its website that it collaborates with the Chinese Research Institute; publishes more than 600 research papers every year with Chinese research institutions; has 225 Chinese staff; 2,600 Chinese students – the biggest international group; 7,000 former students living in China which is the largest group outside the UK; and was selected for a tour by China’s President Xi Jinping during his state visit to the UK in 2015. The college takes major donations from China and describes itself as the UK’s number one university collaborator with Chinese research institutions. The China communist/fascist government did not appear phased by the woeful predictions of Ferguson and Imperial when during the lockdown that Ferguson induced the college signed a five-year collaboration deal with China tech giant Huawei that will have Huawei’s indoor 5G network equipment installed at the college’s West London tech campus along with an ‘AI cloud platform’. The deal includes Chinese sponsorship of Imperial’s Venture Catalyst entrepreneurship competition.

State the 1.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.,"Because DH depends only on the difference between Hfinal and Hinitial, Hess’s law tells us that the difference between the enthalpies of the reactants (1 mol of S and 3 2 mol of O2) and the product (1 mol of SO3) is the same, whether S is oxidized directly to SO3 (impossible) or through the intermediate formation of SO2 (actual). To summarize, calculating an unknown DH involves three steps: 1.  Identify the target equation, the step whose DH is unknown, and note the amount (mol) of each reactant and product. 2.  Manipulate each equation with known DH values so that the target amount (mol) of each substance is on the correct side of the equation. Remember to: • Change the sign of DH when you reverse an equation. • Multiply amount (mol) and DH by the same factor. 3.  Add the manipulated equations and their resulting DH values to get the target equation and its DH. All substances except those in the target equation must cancel. Summary of Section 6.5 •  Because H is a state function, we can use Hess’s law to determine DH of any reaction by assuming that it is the sum of other reactions. •  After manipulating the equations of those reactions and their DH values to match the substances in the target equation, we add the manipulated DH values to find the unknown DH. Sample Problem 6.8 Using Hess’s Law to Calculate an Unknown DH Problem ​ Two pollutants that form in auto exhaust are CO and NO. An environ mental chemist must convert these pollutants to less harmful gases through the following: CO(g) 1 NO(g) - £ CO2(g) 1 1 2N2(g) DH 5 ? Given the following information, calculate the unknown DH: Equation A: CO(g) 1 1 2O2(g) - £ CO2(g) DH 5 2283.0 kJ Equation B: N2(g) 1 O2(g) - £ 2NO(g) DH 5 180.6 kJ Plan ​ We note the amount (mol) of each substance and on which side each appears in the target equation. We manipulate equations A and/or B and their DH values as needed and add them together to obtain the target equation and the unknown DH. Solution ​ Noting substances in the target equation: For reactants, there are 1 mol of CO and 1 mol of NO; for products, there are 1 mol of CO2 and 1 2 mol of N2. Manipulating the given equations: • Equation A has the same amounts of CO and CO2 on the same sides of the arrow as in the target, so we leave it as written. • Equation B has twice as much N2 and NO as the target, and they are on the opposite sides in the target. Thus, we reverse equation B, change the sign of its DH, and multiply both by 1 2: 1 232NO(g) - £ N2(g) 1 O2(g)4",0.0,-3.7416732

What is the formula for this rule?,"43 2.3 Velocity Vector, Average Velocity, and Speed We define vx, the x-component of the velocity vector, as the change in position (i.e., the displacement component) in a given time interval divided by that time interval, x/t. Velocity can change from moment to moment. The velocity calculated by taking the ratio of displacement per time interval is the average of the velocity over this time interval, or the x-component of the average velocity, vx: v x t x =  .  (2.5) Notation: A bar above a symbol is the notation for averaging over a finite time interval. In calculus, a time derivative is obtained by taking a limit as the time interval approaches zero. We use the same concept here to define the instantaneous velocity, usually referred to simply as the velocity, as the time derivative of the displacement. For the x-component of the velocity vector, this implies v v x t dx dt x t x t = = lim lim .     → → 0 0 ≡  (2.6) We can now introduce the velocity vector, v, as the vector for which each component is the time derivative of the corresponding component of the position vector, v dr dt = ,  (2.7) with the understanding that the derivative operation applies to each of the compo- nents of the vector. In the one-dimensional case, this velocity vector v has only an x-component, vx, and the velocity is equivalent to a single velocity component in the spatial x-direction. Figure 2.6 presents three graphs of the position of an object with respect to time. Figure 2.6a shows that we can calculate the average velocity of the object by finding the change in position of the object between two points and dividing by the time it takes to go from x1 to x2. That is, the average velocity is given by the displacement, x1, divided by the time interval, t1, or v1 = x1/t1. In Figure 2.6b, the average velocity, v2 = x2/t2, is determined over a smaller time interval, t2. In Figure 2.6c, the instantaneous velocity, v(t3) = dx/dt|t = t3, is represented by the slope of the blue line tangent to the red curve at t = t3. Velocity is a vector, pointing in the same direction as the vector of the infinitesimal displacement, dx. Because the position x(t) and the displacement x(t) are functions of time, so is the velocity. Because the velocity vector is defined as the time derivative of the displacement vector, all the rules of differentiation introduced in calculus hold. If you need a refresher, consult Appendix A.

What is the formula for 16.1 THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL OF A FUNCTION OF TWO VARIABLES?,"D O U B L E - C H E C K Note that 2 ' = 2/1.20 as demanded by the problem statement. Since E ∝ 2 for the potential well, the energy E2 is lower than that in the infinite well by a factor of (1/1.20)2 = 0.694. This problem is fairly typical. It shows how to use the conditions of continuity of the wave function and its derivatives at boundaries to set up equations that provide the undetermined constants in the generic solution. In this case, the generic solution was of the same type as equation 37.20, with constants U1, D, F, 2 ', and , which were to be determined. The continu- ity of the wave function was expressed in equation (i), and the continuity of the derivative in equation (ii). A third equation was obtained from the relationship between  and 2 ' expressed in equation 37.21. Because 2 ' was specified by the problem statement, we would need four equations to solve for the remaining four unknown quantities. The continuity of  and its derivative at the boundary and the relationship between  and 2 ' would be enough to solve for U1. To find D and F, we would need to use the normalization condition (equation 37.2).

What wave numbers correspond to the possible bound states in this well? Solution The well depth is the same as in Solved Problem 37.1, so one solution for the wave num- ber  should correspond to the value 2/(1.20a), the starting point in that problem. We also found two conditions for the exponential decay constant .

But not all the citizens of Athens the state lived in Athens the town, The territory of Attiké stretched some 60 km from Mt Parnes to Sounion, and some 40 km from Marath6n to the coast opposite the island of Salamis, which itself belonged to Athens. The majority of the Athenian citi- zenry lived in smaller or larger settlements scattered across Attike. The Athenians told the story that once upon a time the largest of these settlements had been independent communities, and that these had then been unified under Athens’ leadership (1.16). Kleisthenés’ reforms at the end of the sixth century (1.25) had given a defined political role to these country towns and villages as “demes’ (d@moi), and throughout the classical period they flourished as local centres. Some of the residents of more outlying demes still had little contact with Athens. As we can deduce from the rich finds of stxth- century sculpture and pottery in local cemeteries, wealthy Athenians cont- inued to live and presumably spend their money tn the settlements of Attike from which they originated, and not simply in the city. Country folk may well have been disinclined to attend political meetings in Athens because of the distance or local loyalties: certainly in the fifth century, men from the town of Athens are peculiarly well represented among state officials, The natural reluctance of residents of Attiké to uproot themselves from ancestral lands and move into town at the beginning of the Peloponnesian War was noted by Thucydides (cf, 1.57): They were heavy-hearted and reluctant to leave their homes and the temples with their traditional and time-honoured institutions, to change their way of lite, and to leave behind what was to them their native city. (Peloponnesian War 2.16) Major festivals certainly tempted some men from outlying parts into town, but most country centres had their own cults, markets and fairs, and tragedy and comedy could be seen in country theatres as well as in the Theatre of Dionysos at Athens (cf. 3.55; 8.46).",1.0,5.6086783

What is the formula for this rule?,"479 return. If Apple decides not to compete with the new Intel model, Intel will earn 30 per- cent and Apple will earn nothing in this mar- ket. Because 20 percent is higher than the minimum 15 percent required return, we can conclude that Apple will enter the mar- ket and both firms will earn a 20 percent return. But suppose that Intel determines that its position relative to Apple is that shown in Figure 2. If Apple enters this market, both Apple and Intel will earn 10 percent returns. If Apple does not enter the market, Intel will earn a 30 percent return. Because 10 percent is below the required return of 15 percent, Apple will not enter the market. In this case, it turns out that whether Figure 1 or Figure 2 more accurately describes the situation in this market is not important for Intel’s initial decision to sell the Ultrabook. Whether Apple enters the market or not, Intel will still earn a return greater than 15 percent. Therefore, Intel should sell the Ultrabook. c Oligopoly firms often try to introduce new products to fill consumer needs better than existing products can, which is what Intel is attempting to do with the Ultra- book. Intel realizes that the computer mar- ket changes quickly, and the company must adapt to these rapid changes by introduc- ing new and better products to remain competitive, relevant, and profitable. Thinking Critically 1. Intel is hoping that its strategy to develop the Ultrabook will increase its share of the laptop computer market. What risks does the company face that could defeat its strategy? 2. Apply the five competitive forces model to Intel. Cite one example of each of the competitive forces that Intel faces. of its competitors. With the Ultrabook, Intel expects to compete with firms such as Ap- ple. This means Intel has to account for the likelihood that its rivals will choose to de- velop models with features similar to those of the Ultrabook. Intel plans to convert 40 percent of consumer laptops to this new model. b Intel announced that its Ultrabook will be priced under $1,000. In an oligopoly market, a firm’s profits depend not only on the price it chooses but on the price its rivals choose. The figures below illustrate the competition between Intel and Apple, using two possible scenarios. In both figures, we assume that Intel has decided to sell its Ultrabook for $999, and Apple must then decide whether it should also develop a new, comparable computer for the same price. We assume that each company needs a 15 percent return on its investment in these computers to break even. In Figure 1, if Apple decides to develop a new model, both companies will earn a 20 percent Key Points in the Article U.S.-based Intel Corp. introduced new products at Taiwan’s Computex computer show: (1) the “Ultrabook,” a laptop–tablet hybrid that is 0.8 inches thick and features a touchscreen, excellent image quality, and an updated processor, and (2) a new processing chip for use in tablets and smartphones. Intel noted that to remain successful, it must quickly adapt to the growth and constant changes in the indus- try. One of Intel’s main competitors is Ap- ple, whose MacBook Air, iPhone, and iPad have been highly successful and profitable products. With its new offerings, scheduled to be available in 2012, Intel is position- ing itself to compete with Apple with what it believes are better and more advanced products.",0.0,-4.130209

By Fermat’s little theorem we know that 710 ≡1 (mod 11), so (710)k ≡1 (mod 11) for every positive integer k. To take advantage of this last congruence, we divide the exponent 222 by 10, finding that 222 = 22 ⋅10 + 2. We now see that 7222 = 722⋅10+2 = (710)2272 ≡(1)22 ⋅49 ≡5 (mod 11).

The world is not mad or anything. 5G can cause major changes to the lungs and blood as I detail in The Answer and these consequences are labelled ‘Covid- 19’, the alleged symptoms of which can be caused by 5G and other electromagnetic frequencies as cells respond to radiation poisoning. The ‘Covid death’ scam Dr ScoĴ Jensen, a Minnesota state senator and medical doctor, exposed ‘Covid’ Medicare payment incentives to hospitals and death certificate manipulation. He said he was sent a seven-page document by the US Department of Health ‘coaching’ him on how to fill out death certificates which had never happened before. The document said that he didn’t need to have a laboratory test for ‘Covid-19’ to put that on the death certificate and that shocked him when death certificates are supposed to be about facts. Jensen described how doctors had been ‘encouraged, if not pressured’ to make a diagnosis of ‘Covid-19’ if they thought it was probable or ‘presumed’. No positive test was necessary – not that this would have maĴered anyway. He said doctors were told to diagnose ‘Covid’ by symptoms when these were the same as colds, allergies, other respiratory problems, and certainly with influenza which ‘disappeared’ in the ‘Covid’ era. A common sniffle was enough to get the dreaded verdict. Ontario authorities decreed that a single care home resident with one symptom from a long list must lead to the isolation of the entire home. Other courageous doctors like Jensen made the same point about death figure manipulation and how deaths by other causes were falling while ‘Covid-19 deaths’ were rising at the same rate due to re-diagnosis.

Then A ∪B is the set of integers not exceeding 1000 that are divisible by either 7 or 11, and A ∩B is the set of integers not exceeding 1000 that are divisible by both 7 and 11. From Example 2 of Section 4.1, we know that among the positive integers not exceeding 1000 there are ⌊1000∕7⌋ integers divisible by 7 and ⌊1000∕11⌋divisible by 11. Because 7 and 11 are relatively prime, the integers divisible by both 7 and 11 are those divisible by 7 ⋅11.

What is the formula for this rule?,"4.51 Therefore, ∫tanxcosx = ∫sinx = −cosx + C. Evaluate ∫⎛ ⎝4x3 −5x2 + x −7⎞ ⎠dx. Initial-Value Problems We look at techniques for integrating a large variety of functions involving products, quotients, and compositions later in the text. Here we turn to one common use for antiderivatives that arises often in many applications: solving differential equations. A differential equation is an equation that relates an unknown function and one or more of its derivatives. The equation (4.9) dy dx = f(x) is a simple example of a differential equation. Solving this equation means finding a function y with a derivative f. Therefore, the solutions of Equation 4.9 are the antiderivatives of f. If F is one antiderivative of f, every function of the form y = F(x) + C is a solution of that differential equation. For example, the solutions of dy dx = 6x2 are given by y = ∫6x2 dx = 2x3 + C. Sometimes we are interested in determining whether a particular solution curve passes through a certain point (x0, y0) —that is, y(x0) = y0. The problem of finding a function y that satisfies a differential equation (4.10) dy dx = f(x) with the additional condition (4.11) y(x0) = y0 is an example of an initial-value problem. The condition y(x0) = y0 is known as an initial condition. For example, looking for a function y that satisfies the differential equation dy dx = 6x2 and the initial condition y(1) = 5 is an example of an initial-value problem. Since the solutions of the differential equation are y = 2x3 + C, to find a function y that also satisfies the initial condition, we need to find C such that y(1) = 2(1)3 + C = 5. From this equation, we see that C = 3, and we conclude that y = 2x3 + 3 is the solution of this initial-value problem as shown in the following graph. 498 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",1.0,0.43390223

What is the formula for this rule?,"We have been examining the behavior of fluids at rest but now turn to fluids in motion. The motion of real-life fluids is complicated and difficult to describe. Numeri- cal techniques and computers are often required to calculate the quantities related to fluid motion. In this section, we consider ideal fluids that can be treated more simply and still yield important and relevant results. To be considered ideal, a fluid must exhibit flow that is laminar, incompressible, nonviscous, and irro- tational. Laminar flow means that the velocity of the mov- ing fluid relative to a fixed point in space does not change with time. A gently flowing river displays lam- inar flow (Figure 13.33a). Water in a waterfall exhibits nonlaminar flow, or turbulent flow (Figure 13.33c). Rising smoke exemplifies a transition from laminar to turbulent flow (Figure 13.33b). The warm smoke initially displays laminar flow as it rises. As the smoke continues to rise, its speed increases until turbulent flow sets in. Incompressible flow means that the density of the liquid does not change as the liq- uid flows. A nonviscous fluid flows completely freely. Some liquids that do not flow freely are pancake syrup and lava. The viscosity of a fluid has an effect analogous to friction. An object moving in a nonviscous liquid experiences no friction-like force, but the same object moving in a viscous liquid is subject to a drag force that is due to the viscosity and is similar to friction. A flowing viscous fluid loses kinetic energy of motion to thermal energy. We assume that ideal fluids do not lose energy as they flow. Irrotational flow means that no part of the fluid rotates about its own center of mass. Rotational motion of a small part of the fluid would mean that the rotating part had rota- tional energy, which is assumed not to occur in ideal fluids. Laminar flow can be described in terms of streamlines (Figure 13.34). A streamline represents the path that a small element of the fluid takes over time. The velocity, v, of the small element is always tangent to the streamline. Note that streamlines never cross; if they did, the velocity of flow at the crossing point would have two values. Bernoulli’s Equation What provides the lift that allows an airplane to fly through the air? To understand this phenomenon, you can do a simple demonstration with two empty soft-drink cans and five drinking straws. Place each empty can on two straws, with a gap of approximately 1 cm between them, as shown in Figure 13.35. In this arrangement, the cans are able to make lateral movements relatively easily. Now, using the fifth straw, blow air through the gap between the cans. What happens? (This question will be answered later in the section.) To begin our studies of fluid motion, let us first introduce the equation of continuity. Consider an ideal fluid flowing with speed v in a container or pipe with cross-sectional area A (Figure 13.36). Then V is the volume of fluid that flows through the pipe during time t and is given by    V A x Av t = = . We can write the volume of fluid passing a given point in the pipe per unit time as   V t Av = . Now consider an ideal fluid flowing in a pipe that has a cross-sectional area that changes (Figure 13.37).",0.0,-3.4798357

What is the formula for this rule?,"The Marginal Product of Labor and the Average Product of Labor 361 the division of labor, output at first increases at an increasing rate, with each additional worker hired causing production to increase by a greater amount than did the hiring of the previous worker. But after the second worker has been hired, hiring more work- ers while keeping the quantity of ovens constant results in diminishing returns. When the point of diminishing returns is reached, production increases at a decreasing rate. Each additional worker hired after the second worker causes production to increase by a smaller amount than did the hiring of the previous worker. In panel (b), the marginal product of labor curve rises initially because of the effects of specialization and division of labor, and then it falls due to the effects of diminishing returns. Adam Smith’s Famous Account of the Division of Labor in a Pin Factory In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith uses production in a pin factory as an example of the gains in output resulting from the division of labor. The fol- lowing is an excerpt from his account of how pin making was divided into a series of tasks: One man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a [distinct operation], to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into eighteen distinct operations. Because the labor of pin making was divided up in this way, the average worker was able to produce about 4,800 pins per day. Smith speculated that a single worker using the pin-making machinery alone would make only about 20 pins per day. This lesson from more than 225 years ago, showing the tremendous gains from division of labor and spe- cialization, remains relevant to most business situations today. From Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol. I, (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1976. original edition, 1776), pp. 14–15. Your Turn: Test your understanding by doing related problem 3.7 on page 378 at the end of this chapter. MyEconLab Making the Connection The gains from division of labor and specialization are as important to firms today as they were in the eighteenth century, when Adam Smith first discussed them. The Relationship between Marginal Product and Average Product The marginal product of labor tells us how much total output changes as the quantity of workers hired changes. We can also calculate how many pizzas workers produce on average. The average product of labor is the total output produced by a firm divided by the quantity of workers. For example, using the numbers in Table 11.3 on page 359, if Jill hires 4 workers to produce 600 pizzas, the average product of labor is 600>4 = 150. We can state the relationship between the marginal and average products of labor this way: The average product of labor is the average of the marginal products of labor. For example, the numbers from Table 11.3 show that the marginal product of the first worker Jill hires is 200, the marginal product of the second worker is 250, and the mar- ginal product of the third worker is 100. Therefore, the average product of labor for three workers is 183.3: Average product of labor The total output produced by a firm divided by the quantity of workers.",0.0,-3.0648282

The fourth statement tells us that ¬t must be true. Therefore, by modus ponens with the first statement, we know that ¬g is true, hence (from the second statement), that ¬q is true. Also, the fourth statement tells us that r must be true, and so again modus ponens (third statement) makes q true. This is a contradiction: q∧¬q. Thus, the statements are inconsistent. 11.

What is the formula for 9.5 POWER SERIES AND INTERVAL OF CONVERGENCE?,"Four Categories of Goods 155 The Demand for a Public Good We can determine the market demand curve for a good or service by adding up the quantity of the good demanded by each consumer at each price. To keep things simple, let’s consider the case of a market with only two consumers. Figure 5.8 shows that the market demand curve for hamburgers depends on the individual demand curves of Jill and Joe. At a price of $4.00, Jill demands 2 hamburgers per week and Joe demands 4. Add- ing horizontally, the combination of a price of $4.00 per hamburger and a quantity de- manded of 6 hamburgers will be a point on the market demand curve for hamburgers. Similarly, adding horizontally at a price of $1.50, we have a price of $1.50 and a quantity demanded of 11 as another point on the market demand curve. A consumer’s demand curve for a good represents the marginal benefit the consumer receives from the good, so when we add together the consumers’ demand curves, we not only have the market demand curve but also the marginal social benefit curve for this good, assuming that there is no externality in consumption. How can we find the demand curve or marginal social benefit curve for a public good? Once again, for simplicity, assume that Jill and Joe are the only consumers. Un- like with a private good, where Jill and Joe can end up consuming different quantities, with a public good, they will consume the same quantity. Suppose that Jill owns a service station on an isolated rural road, and Joe owns a car dealership next door. These are the only two businesses around for miles. Both Jill and Joe are afraid that unless they hire a security guard at night, their businesses may be burgled. Like national defense, the ser- vices of a security guard are in this case a public good: Once hired, the guard will be able to protect both businesses, so the good is nonrival. It also will not be possible to exclude either business from being protected, so the good is nonexcludable. To arrive at a demand curve for a public good, we don’t add quantities at each price, as with a private good. Instead, we add the price each consumer is willing to pay for each quantity of the public good. This value represents the total dollar amount consumers as a group would be willing to pay for that quantity of the public good. Put another way, to find the demand curve, or marginal social benefit curve, for a pri- vate good, we add the demand curves of individual consumers horizontally; for public goods, we add individual demand curves vertically. Figure 5.9 shows how the marginal social benefit curve for security guard services depends on the individual demand curves of Jill and Joe.

He was also asked if ‘vaccines’ could be made to target difference races.

An onto function from a set with m elements to a set with n elements corresponds to a way to distribute the m elements in the domain to n indistinguishable boxes so that no box is empty, and then to associate each of the n elements of the codomain to a box. This means that the number of onto functions from a set with m elements to a set with n elements is the number Counting onto functions is much harder than counting one-to-one functions! of ways to distribute m distinguishable objects to n indistinguishable boxes so that no box is empty multiplied by the number of permutations of a set with n elements.

What is the formula for this rule?,"This section discusses the root-mean-square values of currents and voltages, rather than the maximum or instantaneous values. The result obtained for the power is always the average power when root-mean-square values are used. This practice is the convention normally followed by scientists, engineers, and electricians dealing with AC circuits. In an AC circuit that has only a resistor, the phase constant is zero. Thus, we can express the power as P IV = . (30.41) For a given power delivered to a circuit, the application dictates the choice of high current or high voltage. For example, to provide enough power to operate a computer or a vacuum cleaner, using a high voltage might be dangerous. The design of electric generators is com- plicated by the use of high voltages. Therefore, in these devices, lower voltages and higher currents are advantageous. However, the transmission of electric power requires the opposite condition. The power dissipated in a transmission line is given by P = I2R. Thus, the power lost in a line, like those in Figure 30.32a is proportional to the square of the current in the line. As an example, consider a power plant that produces 500. MW of power. If the power is transmit- ted at 350. kV, the current in the power lines will be ⋅ ⋅ I P V = = 500. MW 350. kV = 5.00 10 W 3.50 10 V =1.43 kA. 8 5 If the total resistance of the power lines is 50. , the power lost in the transmission lines is P I R = = 1.43 kA 50.0 =102.MW, 2 2  ( ) ( ) or about 20% of the generated power. A similar calculation would show that transmitting the power at 200. kV instead of 350. kV would increase the power loss by a factor of 3.1. Thus, approximately 60% of the power generated would be lost in transmission. This is why the transmission of electric power is always done at the highest possible voltage. The ability to change voltage allows electric power to be generated and used at low, safe volt- ages but transmitted at the highest practical voltage. Alternating currents and voltages are trans- formed from high to low values by a device called, appropriately, a transformer.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Appendix The Gold Standard and the Bretton Woods System The Gold Standard and the Bretton Woods System It is easier to understand the current exchange rate system by considering further two earlier systems, the gold standard and the Bretton Woods system, which together lasted from the early nineteenth century through the early 1970s. The Gold Standard As we saw in this chapter, under the gold standard, the currency of a country consisted of gold coins and paper currency that could be redeemed for gold. Great Britain ad- opted the gold standard in 1816, but as late as 1870, only a few nations had followed. In the late nineteenth century, however, Great Britain’s share of world trade had increased, as had its overseas investments. The dominant position of Great Britain in the world economy motivated other countries to adopt the gold standard. By 1913, every country in Europe, except Spain and Bulgaria, and most countries in the Western Hemisphere had adopted the gold standard. Under the gold standard, the exchange rate between two currencies was automati- cally determined by the quantity of gold in each currency. If there was 1/5 ounce of gold in a U.S. dollar and 1 ounce of gold in a British pound, the price of gold in the United States would be $5 per ounce, and the price of gold in Britain would be £1 per ounce. The exchange rate would therefore be +5 = £1. The End of the Gold Standard From a modern point of view, the greatest drawback to the gold standard was that the central bank lacked control of the money supply. The size of a country’s money supply depended on its gold supply, which could be greatly affected by chance discoveries of gold or by technological change in gold mining. For example, the gold discoveries in California in 1849 and Alaska in the 1890s caused rapid increases in the U.S. money supply. Because the central bank cannot determine how much gold will be discovered, it lacks the control of the money supply necessary to pursue an active monetary pol- icy. During wartime, countries usually went off the gold standard to allow their central banks to expand the money supply as rapidly as was necessary to pay for the war. Britain abandoned the gold standard at the beginning of World War I in 1914 and did not re- sume redeeming its paper currency for gold until 1925. When the Great Depression began in 1929, governments came under pressure to abandon the gold standard to allow their central banks to pursue active monetary policies. In 1931, Great Britain became the first major country to abandon the gold standard. A number of other countries also went off the gold standard that year. The United States remained on the gold standard until 1933, and a few countries, including France, Italy, and Belgium, stayed on even longer. By the late 1930s, the gold standard had collapsed. The earlier a country abandoned the gold standard, the easier time it had fight- ing the Depression with expansionary monetary policies. The countries that abandoned the gold standard by 1932 suffered an average decline in production of only 3 percent",0.0,-4.7587776

Use pseudocode to describe an algorithm for determining the value of a game tree when both players follow a minmax strategy. 11.3 Tree Traversal 11.3.1 Introduction Ordered rooted trees are often used to store information. We need procedures for visiting each Links vertex of an ordered rooted tree to access data. We will describe several important algorithms for visiting all the vertices of an ordered rooted tree. Ordered rooted trees can also be used to represent various types of expressions, such as arithmetic expressions involving numbers, variables, and operations. The different listings of the vertices of ordered rooted trees used to represent expressions are useful in the evaluation of these expressions. 11.3.2 Universal Address Systems Procedures for traversing all vertices of an ordered rooted tree rely on the orderings of children. In ordered rooted trees, the children of an internal vertex are shown from left to right in the drawings representing these directed graphs. We will describe one way we can totally order the vertices of an ordered rooted tree. To produce this ordering, we must first label all the vertices. We do this recursively: 1. Label the root with the integer 0. Then label its k children (at level 1) from left to right with 1, 2, 3, ... , k. 2. For each vertex v at level n with label A, label its kv children, as they are drawn from left to right, with A.1, A.2, ... , A.kv. Following this procedure, a vertex v at level n, for n ≥1, is labeled x1.x2. ... .xn, where the unique path from the root to v goes through the x1st vertex at level 1, the x2nd vertex at level 2, and so on. This labeling is called the universal address system of the ordered rooted tree. We can totally order the vertices using the lexicographic ordering of their labels in the uni- versal address system.",0.0,-7.2737756

This measue is similar to ROE, except it compares earnings to both equity and debt, reflecting the view that executives use both forms of capital to finance the business. Methods for calculating ROIC are discussed in advanced courses in financial statement analysis. (5) Earnings per Share (EPS) Earnings per share (EPS) indicates the amount of earn ings generated for each share of outstanding common stock. Consistent with the increase in ROE, the EPS ratio increased from $2.84 in 2018 to $5.49 in 2019, as shown below. This represents an increase of $2.65 per share ($5.49 − $2.84). (6) Price/Earnings (P/E) Ratio The P/E ratio relates the company’s stock price to its EPS, as follows: Using the stock price immediately after Lowe’s announced its fiscal 2019 and 2018 earn ings (on February 26, 2020, and February 27, 2019), the P/E ratio was 20.6 and 37.9, respec tively. This means investors were willing to pay 20.6 times earnings to buy a share of Lowe’s stock in early 2020 (versus 37.9 times earnings a year earlier). The decrease from the prior year suggests investors were less optimistic about the company’s future than they were the year before. The effects of increased tariffs and uncertainty about the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic dampened investors’ outlook for 2020 and beyond. Let’s pause to summarize what we’ve learned so far. Lowe’s had a mixed year in fiscal 2019. On the positive side, the company saw a slight increase in 2019 sales revenue despite having closed more than 150 stores over the previous two years. More revenue combined with fewer stores led to an increase in Lowe’s fixed asset turnover in 2019. Lowe’s also enjoyed an increase in net income in 2019, causing EPS and ROE to increase significantly over the previous year. However, the increase in net income wasn’t all good news because it was partly attributable to higher-than-normal impairment losses in 2018 rather than across-the- board improvements in 2019. Gross profit percentage, for example, declined in 2019 because Lowe’s was unable to pass on to consumers increased tariff costs on imported building mate rials. This news, combined with the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting global recession, was concerning to investors, as indicated by Lowe’s decreased P/E ratio.

What is the formula for this rule?,"The most obvious is to hire someone (an auditor) to ensure the work done by others within the company is appropriate and supported by documentation. Independent verification also can be made part of a person’s job. For example, before a check is issued to pay the bill for a truckload of merchandise, a clerk first verifies the bill relates to goods actually received and is calculated correctly. A third form of independent verification involves comparing the company’s accounting information to information kept by an independent third party. For example, the company may compare internal cash records to a statement of account issued by the bank. The next section of this chapter demonstrates this procedure, called a bank reconciliation. Control Limitations Internal controls can never completely prevent and detect errors and fraud for two rea sons. First, an organization will implement internal controls only to the extent their ben efits exceed their costs. Companies could nearly eliminate shoplifting by body searching every customer who leaves the store, but such an irritating policy would soon drive custom ers away. The cost of the lost sales would far exceed the benefits of reduced shoplifting. For smaller companies, the cost of hiring additional employees to fully segregate duties exceeds the benefits. In these cases, other controls such as independent verification by top management must compensate for the lack of segregation of duties. A second limitation is internal controls can fail as a result of human error or fraud.

What is the formula for ICN3?,"there was no good evidence implicating the new ‘virus’. Editors rejected his manuscripts and his research funds were deleted. Mullis points out that the CDC has defined AIDS as one of more than 30 diseases if accompanied by a positive result on a test that detects antibodies to HIV; but those same diseases are not defined as AIDS cases when antibodies are not detected: If an HIV-positive woman develops uterine cancer, for example, she is considered to have AIDS. If she is not HIV positive, she simply has uterine cancer. An HIV-positive man with tuberculosis has AIDS; if he tests negative he simply has tuberculosis. If he lives in Kenya or Colombia, where the test for HIV antibodies is too expensive, he is simply presumed to have the antibodies and therefore AIDS, and therefore he can be treated in the World Health Organization’s clinic. It’s the only medical help available in some places. And it’s free, because the countries that support WHO are worried about AIDS. Mullis accuses the CDC of continually adding new diseases (see ever more ‘Covid symptoms’) to the grand AIDS definition and of virtually doctoring the books to make it appear as if the disease continued to spread. He cites how in 1993 the CDC enormously broadened its AIDS definition and county health authorities were delighted because they received $2,500 per year from the Federal government for every reported AIDS case. Ladies and gentlemen, I have just described, via Kary Mullis, the ‘Covid pandemic’ of 2020 and beyond. Every element is the same and it’s been pulled off in the same way by the same networks. The ‘Covid virus’ exists? Okay – prove it. Er ... still waiting What Kary Mullis described with regard to ‘HIV’ has been repeated with ‘Covid’. A claim is made that a new, or ‘novel’, infection has been found and the entire medical system of the world repeats that as fact exactly as they did with HIV and AIDS. No one in the mainstream asks rather relevant questions such as ‘How do you know?’ and ‘Where is your proof?’ The SARS-Cov-2 ‘virus’ and the ‘Covid-19 disease’ became an overnight ‘everybody-knows-that’.

What is the formula for 92 Chapter 3 • Stoichiometry of Formulas and Equations?,"Sample Problem 3.16   Calculating Quantities of Reactants and Products: Mass to Mass Problem ​ During the roasting of chalcocite, how many kilograms of oxygen are required to form 2.86 kg of copper(I) oxide? Plan ​ In this problem, we know the mass of the product, Cu2O (2.86 kg), and we need the mass (kg) of O2 that reacts to form it. Therefore, we must convert from mass of product to amount of product to amount of reactant to mass of reactant. We convert the mass of Cu2O from kg to g and then to amount (mol). Then, we use the molar ratio (3 mol O2/2 mol Cu2O) to find the amount (mol) of O2 required. Finally, we convert amount of O2 to g and then kg (see bottom road map). Solution ​ Converting from kilograms of Cu2O to moles of Cu2O: Combining the mass unit conversion with the mass-to-amount conversion gives Amount (mol) of Cu2O 5 2.86 kg Cu2O 3 103 g 1 kg 3 1 mol Cu2O 143.10 g Cu2O 5 20.0 mol Cu2O Converting from moles of Cu2O to moles of O2: Amount (mol) of O2 5 20.0 mol Cu2O 3 3 mol O2 2 mol Cu2O 5 30.0 mol O2 Amount (mol) of Cu2S molar ratio Amount (mol) of SO2 multiply by  (g/mol) Mass (g) of SO2 Road Map 3.15 1 kg 5 103 g divide by  (g/mol) molar ratio multiply by  (g/mol) 103 g 5 1 kg Mass (kg) of Cu2O Mass (g) of Cu2O Amount (mol) of Cu2O Amount (mol) of O2 Mass (g) of O2 Mass (kg) of O2 Road Map 3.16 Solution ​ Calculating the amount of O2: Amount (mol) of O2 5 10.0 mol Cu2S 3 3 mol O2 2 mol Cu2S 5 15.0 mol O2 Check ​ The units are correct, and the answer is reasonable because this molar ratio of O2 to Cu2S (15/10) is identical to the ratio in the balanced equation (3/2). Comment ​ A common mistake is to invert the conversion factor; that calculation would be Amount (mol) of O2 5 10.0 mol Cu2S 3 2 mol Cu2S 3 mol O2 5 6.67 mol2 Cu2S 1 mol O2 The strange units should alert you that an error was made in setting up the conversion factor. Also note that this answer, 6.67, is less than 10.0, whereas the equation shows that there should be more moles of O2 (3 mol) than moles of Cu2S (2 mol). Be sure to think through the calculation when setting up the conversion factor and canceling units.

What is the formula for this rule?,"211 7.6 Totally Inelastic Collisions Ballistic Pendulum A ballistic pendulum is a device that can be used to measure muzzle speeds of projectiles shot from firearms. It consists of a block of material into which the bullet is fired. This block is suspended so that it forms a pendulum (Figure 7.14). From the deflection angle of the pendulum and the known masses of the bullet, m, and the block, M, we can calculate the speed of the bullet right before it hits the block. To obtain an expression for the speed of the bullet in terms of the deflection angle, we have to calculate the speed of the block-plus-bullet combination right after the bullet is embedded in the block. This collision is a prototypical totally inelastic collision, and thus we can apply equation 7.21. Because the pendulum is at rest before the bullet hits it, the speed of the block-plus-bullet combination is v m m M v = b + , where vb is the speed of the bullet before it hits the block and v is the speed of the combined masses right after impact. The kinetic energy of the bullet is Kb = 1 2mv2 b just before it hits the block, whereas right after the collision, the block-plus-bullet combination has the kinetic energy K m M v m M m m M v mv = = = b 1 2 2 1 2 2 1 2 ( ) ( ) + + +             b b 2 m m M m m M K + = + . (7.22) Clearly, kinetic energy is not conserved in the process whereby the bullet embeds in the block. (With a real ballistic pendulum, the kinetic energy is transferred into deformation of bullet and block. In this demonstration version, kinetic energy is transferred into frictional work between the bullet and the block.) Equation 7.22 shows that the total kinetic energy (and with it the total mechanical energy) is reduced by a factor of m/(m + M). However, after the collision, the block-plus-bullet combination retains its remaining total energy in the ensuing pendulum motion, converting all of the initial kinetic energy of equation 7.22 into potential energy at the highest point: U m M gh K m m M v max ( ) . = = = b + +               1 2 2 2 (7.23) As you can see from Figure 7.14b, the height h and angle  are related via h = (1 – cos ), where  is the length of the pendulum.

They were charged with financial statement fraud for improperly recording 35 days of sales in September—a month that has only 30 days. To make it look like managers had met their September sales targets, CA included sales from the first five days of October in its September income statement. This accounting fraud led managers to be paid bonuses they hadn’t earned and tricked investors into thinking CA was a successful company. When the truth was revealed later, CA’s stockholders quickly abandoned the company, causing its stock price to fall 43 percent in a single day. CA ultimately paid stockholders $225 million to make up for its bad accounting and agreed to ensure all inappropriate management bonuses were paid back to the company.

For example, once we have found the values of the three children of the root, which are 1, −1, and −1, we find the value of the root by computing max(1, −1, −1) = 1. Because the value of the root is 1, it follows that the first player wins when both players follow a minmax strategy. ◂ Game trees for some well-known games can be extraordinarily large, because these games have many different possible moves. For example, the game tree for chess has been estimated to have as many as 10100 vertices! It may be impossible to use Theorem 3 directly to study a game because of the size of the game tree. Therefore, various approaches have been devised to help determine good strategies and to determine the outcome of such games. One useful technique, called alpha-beta pruning, eliminates much computation by pruning portions of the game tree that cannot affect the values of ancestor vertices. (For information about alpha-beta pruning, consult [Gr90].) Another useful approach is to use evaluation functions, which estimate the Chess programs on smartphones can now play at the grandmaster level. value of internal vertices in the game tree when it is not feasible to compute these values exactly. For example, in the game of tic-tac-toe, as an evaluation function for a position, we may use the number of files (rows, columns, and diagonals) containing no Os (used to indicate moves of the second player) minus the number of files containing no Xs (used to indicate moves of the first player). This evaluation function provides some indication of which player has the advantage in the game. Once the values of an evaluation function are inserted, the value of the game can be computed following the rules used for the minmax strategy. Computer programs created to play chess, such as IBM’s Deep Blue, the first chess-playing computer to win a match against a current world champion under regular rules, are based on sophisticated evaluation functions.

Use mathematical induction to prove that the algorithm you devised in Exercise 47 produces an optimal solution, that is, that it uses the fewest towers possible to provide cellular service to all buildings. Exercises 49–51 present incorrect proofs using mathemati- cal induction. You will need to identify an error in reasoning in each exercise. 49. What is wrong with this “proof” that all horses are the same color? Let P(n) be the proposition that all the horses in a set of n horses are the same color. Basis Step: Clearly, P(1) is true. Inductive Step: Assume that P(k) is true, so that all the horses in any set of k horses are the same color. Consider any k + 1 horses; number these as horses 1, 2, 3, ... , k, k + 1. Now the first k of these horses all must have the same color, and the last k of these must also have the same color. Because the set of the first k horses and the set of the last k horses overlap, all k + 1 must be the same color. This shows that P(k + 1) is true and finishes the proof by induction. 50. What is wrong with this “proof”? “Theorem” For every positive integer n, ∑n i = 1 i = (n + 1 2)2∕2. Basis Step: The formula is true for n = 1. Inductive Step: Suppose that ∑n i=1 i = (n + 1 2)2∕2. Then ∑n+1 i=1 i = (∑n i=1 i) + (n + 1). By the inductive hypothesis, we have ∑n+1 i=1 i = (n + 1 2)2∕2 + n + 1 = (n2 + n + 1 4)∕2 + n + 1 = (n2 + 3n + 9 4)∕2 = (n + 3 2)2∕2 = [(n + 1) + 1 2]2∕2, completing the inductive step. 51. What is wrong with this “proof”? “Theorem” For every positive integer n, if x and y are positive integers with max(x, y) = n, then x = y. Basis Step: Suppose that n = 1. If max(x, y) = 1 and x and y are positive integers, we have x = 1 and y = 1. Inductive Step: Let k be a positive integer. Assume that whenever max(x, y) = k and x and y are positive integers, then x = y. Now let max(x, y) = k + 1, where x and y are positive integers. Then max(x −1, y −1) = k, so by the inductive hypothesis, x −1 = y −1. It follows that x = y, completing the inductive step.",1.0,-0.42530492

What is the formula for SOLUTION?,"449 Solution: To count the number of solutions, we note that a solution corresponds to a way of selecting 11 items from a set with three elements so that x1 items of type one, x2 items of type two, and x3 items of type three are chosen. Hence, the number of solutions is equal to the number of 11-combinations with repetition allowed from a set with three elements. From Theorem 2 it follows that there are C(3 + 11 −1, 11) = C(13, 11) = C(13, 2) = 13 ⋅12 1 ⋅2 = 78 solutions. The number of solutions of this equation can also be found when the variables are subject to constraints. For instance, we can find the number of solutions where the variables are integers with x1 ≥1, x2 ≥2, and x3 ≥3. A solution to the equation subject to these constraints corre- sponds to a selection of 11 items with x1 items of type one, x2 items of type two, and x3 items of type three, where, in addition, there is at least one item of type one, two items of type two, and three items of type three. So, a solution corresponds to a choice of one item of type one, two of type two, and three of type three, together with a choice of five additional items of any type. By Theorem 2 this can be done in C(3 + 5 −1, 5) = C(7, 5) = C(7, 2) = 7 ⋅6 1 ⋅2 = 21 ways. Thus, there are 21 solutions of the equation subject to the given constraints. ◂ Example 6 shows how counting the number of combinations with repetition allowed arises in determining the value of a variable that is incremented each time a certain type of nested loop is traversed.",0.0,4.6869826

What is the formula for EXAMPLE 6?,"Government Policy toward Monopoly 507 Should AT&T Have Been Allowed to Merge with T-Mobile? In early 2011, AT&T agreed to buy T-Mobile from its parent firm Deutsche Telekom for $39 billion. AT&T is the sec- ond largest mobile wireless firm in the United States, and T-Mobile is the fourth largest. (In 2011, Verizon Wireless was the largest wireless firm, and Sprint Nextel was the third largest.) As we have seen, the two main ways that a merger between two large firms can increase the combined firm’s profits are by (1) increasing market power so as to increase prices and (2) lowering costs through increased effi- ciency. The federal government may see the first motive as violating the antitrust laws, so firms typically emphasize the second motive. AT&T argued that the combined company, which would become the largest wireless firm in the United States, could operate at lower cost than could the companies operating separately. For instance, the two companies had 9,200 retail stores, but 41 percent of AT&T’s stores had one or more T-Mobile stores within 1 mile. Closing hundreds of these stores would lower the combined company’s costs. The combined company would also be able to reduce its technical and customer support staffs, among other savings. AT&T estimated the cost savings from the merger at $3 billion per year. In principle, these costs savings could lead to a situation like the one illustrated in Figure 15.6, where consumers benefit from a merger. AT&T needed to emphasize cost savings and efficiency gains because it was pro- posing a horizontal merger that would sharply increase concentration in the wireless industry. In fact, after studying the proposed merger for several months, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice filed a lawsuit to stop the merger. The govern- ment argued that the relevant market for judging the merger was the market for wire- less services, because they argued that traditional landline telephones “are not regarded by consumers of mobile wireless telecommunications as reasonable substitutes.” As a result, the government estimated that an increase in price by all mobile wireless com- panies would increase the companies’ profits. In the national market, the merger would increase the HHI by nearly 700 points, from about 2,400 to about 3,100. Looking at just the market for wireless services purchased by businesses and the government, the HHI would increase from about 3,100 to about 3,400. In all of the 40 largest cities, the in- crease in HHI from the merger would be more than 200 points. These increases in HHI called the merger into question under the merger guidelines discussed earlier. Despite these increases in HHI, the government might not have opposed the merger if it had accepted AT&T’s argument that the merger would result in efficiencies that would lead to cost reductions. The government’s merger guidelines state that the government will con- sider whether “efficiencies likely would be sufficient to reverse the merger’s potential to harm customers in the relevant market . . . by preventing price increases in that market.” How- ever, the Antitrust Division’s economists rejected AT&T’s arguments that cost savings would offset the increased market power the newly merged firm would acquire.",0.0,-1.5564344

What is the formula for EXERCISES?,"Chapter Summary and Problems 191 Summary Corporate governance refers to the way in which a corpora- tion is structured and the impact a corporation’s structure has on the firm’s behavior. Most corporations have a similar man- agement structure: The shareholders elect a board of directors that appoints the corporation’s top managers, such as the chief executive officer (CEO). Because the top management often does not own a large fraction of the stock in the corporation, large corporations have a separation of ownership from con- trol. Because top managers have less incentive to increase the corporation’s profits than to increase their own salaries and their own enjoyment, corporations can suffer from the principal– agent problem. The principal–agent problem exists when the principals—in this case, the shareholders of the corporation— have difficulty getting the agent—the corporation’s top manage- ment—to carry out their wishes.

What is the formula for this rule?,"358 C H A P T E R 1 1 Long-Run Economic Growth: Sources and Policies for the delivery of hides. The shoe wholesaler enters into contracts to deliver shoes to retail stores, where they are sold to consumers. For the flow of goods from cattle ranch- ers to shoe customers to operate efficiently, each business must carry out the terms of the contract it has signed. In developed countries, such as the United States, businesses know that if they fail to carry out a contract, they may be sued in court and forced to compensate the other party for any economic damages. Many developing countries do not have functioning, independent court systems. Even if a court system does exist, a case may not be heard for many years. In some countries, bribery of judges and political favoritism in court rulings are common. If firms cannot enforce contracts through the court system, they will insist on carrying out only face-to-face cash transactions. For example, the shoe manufacturer will wait until the leather producer brings the hides to the factory and will then buy them for cash. The wholesaler will wait until the shoes have been produced before making plans for sales to retail stores. Production still takes place, but it is carried out more slowly and inef- ficiently. With slow and inefficient production, firms have difficulty finding investors willing to provide them with the funds they need to expand. What Do Parking Tickets in New York City Tell Us about Poverty in the Developing World? In many developing countries, government officials insist on receiving bribes to process most transactions. For example, someone may need to pay an official before being allowed to open a shoe store or to purchase farm land. This corruption represents a breakdown in the rule of law. Generally, the more corrupt a country’s government, the lower the country’s growth rate. Economists at the World Bank have developed an index that ranks the countries of the world from most cor- rupt to least corrupt. The figure below compares GDP per capita in the 20 most cor- rupt and the 20 least corrupt countries. GDP per capita is more than 10 times higher in the least corrupt countries than in the most corrupt countries. But does corruption cause countries to be poor, or does a country’s being poor lead to its being corrupt? Some economists have made the controversial argument that cor- ruption may be the result of culture. If a culture of corruption exists in a country, then the country may have great difficulty establishing an honest government that is will- ing to enforce the rule of law. Economists Raymond Fisman of the Columbia Business School and Edward Miguel of the University of California, Berkeley, came up with an ingenious method of testing whether a culture of corruption exists in some countries. Every country in the world sends delegates to the United Nations in New York City. Under international law, these delegates cannot be prosecuted for violating U.S. laws, including parking regulations. So, a delegate to the United Nations can double park or park next to a fire hydrant and ignore any parking ticket he or she would receive.

In the fifth and fourth centuries Athens was strongly dependent upon what was brought in by sea, for two reasons: first, Attiké did not produce enough cereals for the urban population; and second, Athens and the Peiraicus flourished on a reputation for being the place to which one came to find goods from all over the Greek world (cf. 2.27, 5.58). Few voyages would have been taken for pleasure, as pirates were a constant source of danger until the Athenians cleared them from the Aegean in the 470s. Nor was a sea-voyage possible at all times of the year (3.25). The islands lying within the Aegean basin enabled sailors to chart their course by reference to fixed points, but traders did not avoid the open sea. The slow, broad cargo-ships depended on sail and wind, and travelled at an average speed of five knots. Nelson’s Victory, a much larger and heavier warship with sails, averaged seven knots. Ships powered by oars were swifter than sailing ships, but were used mainly in time of war. The trireme, with 170 rowers, was the fastest and the finest man-of-war in the classical period. It could reach a speed of seven to eight knots with a continuous power output, or even up to 13 knots for a short burst of ten to twenty minutes. But with their complement of about two hundred and their need to be as light as pos- sible, they carried few provisions and had to put in frequently to enable the rowers to rest and eat (cf. 7,34—-5). Greek cargo-ships, however, with their small number of crew and their heavy loads, had no reason for rationing the supply",0.0,-4.2742553

What is the formula for this rule?,"SOCIETY/Science Source GODFREY HAROLD HARDY (1877–1947) Hardy, born in Cranleigh, Surrey, England, was the older of Links two children of Isaac Hardy and Sophia Hall Hardy. His father was the geography and drawing master at the Cranleigh School and also gave singing lessons and played soccer. His mother gave piano lessons and helped run a boardinghouse for young students. Hardy’s parents were devoted to their children’s education. Hardy demon- strated his numerical ability at the early age of two when he began writing down numbers into the millions. He had a private mathematics tutor rather than attending regular classes at the Cranleigh School. He moved to Winchester College, a private high school, when he was 13 and was awarded a scholarship. He excelled in his studies and demonstrated a strong interest in mathematics. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1896 on a scholarship and won several prizes during his time there, graduating in 1899. Hardy held the position of lecturer in mathematics at Trinity College at Cambridge University from 1906 to 1919, when he was appointed to the Sullivan chair of geometry at Oxford. He had become un- happy with Cambridge over the dismissal of the noted philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russell from Trinity for antiwar activities and did not like a heavy load of administrative duties. In 1931 he returned to Cambridge as the Sadleirian professor of pure mathematics, where he remained until his retirement in 1942. He was a pure mathematician and held an elitist view of mathematics, hoping that his research could never be applied. Ironically, he is perhaps best known as one of the developers of the Hardy–Weinberg law, which predicts patterns of inheritance. His work in this area appeared as a letter to the journal Science in which he used simple algebraic ideas to demonstrate errors in an article on genetics. Hardy worked primarily in number theory and function theory, exploring such topics as the Riemann zeta function, Fourier series, and the distribution of primes. He made many important contributions to many important problems, such as Waring’s problem about representing positive integers as sums of kth powers and the problem of representing odd integers as sums of three primes. Hardy is also remembered for his collaborations with John E. Littlewood, a colleague at Cambridge, with whom he wrote more than 100 papers, and the celebrated Indian mathematical prodigy Srinivasa Ramanujan. His collaboration with Littlewood led to the joke that there were only three important English mathematicians at that time, Hardy, Littlewood, and Hardy–Littlewood. However, some people believed that Hardy had invented a fictitious person, Littlewood, because Littlewood was seldom seen away from Cambridge. Hardy had the wisdom of recognizing Ramanujan’s genius from unconventional but extremely creative writings Ramanujan sent him, while other mathematicians failed to see the genius. Hardy brought Ramanujan to Cambridge and collaborated on important joint papers, establishing new results on the number of partitions of an integer. Hardy was interested in mathematics education, and his book A Course of Pure Mathematics had a profound effect on undergraduate instruction in mathematics in the first half of the twentieth century. Hardy also wrote A Mathematician’s Apology, in which he gives his answer to the question of whether it is worthwhile to devote one’s life to the study of mathematics. It presents Hardy’s view of what mathematics is and what a mathematician does. Hardy had a strong interest in sports. He was an avid cricket fan and followed scores closely.",0.0,-4.0858927
What is the formula for 96 Gods and festivals?,"Show that the set of real numbers is an uncountable set. Solution: To show that the set of real numbers is uncountable, we suppose that the set of real Extra Examples numbers is countable and arrive at a contradiction. Then, the subset of all real numbers that fall between 0 and 1 would also be countable (because any subset of a countable set is also countable; see Exercise 16). Under this assumption, the real numbers between 0 and 1 can be listed in some order, say, r1, r2, r3, ... . Let the decimal representation of these real numbers be r1 = 0.d11d12d13d14 ... r2 = 0.d21d22d23d24 ... r3 = 0.d31d32d33d34 ... r4 = 0.d41d42d43d44 ... ⋮ where dij ∈{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.

What is the formula for 4.6 RATES AND RELATED RATES?,"The largest and smallest values of a quantity often have practical importance. For example, automo- bile engineers want to construct a car that uses the smallest amountof fuel, scientists want to calculate which wavelength carries the maximum radiation at a given temperature, and urban planners want to design traffic patterns to minimize delays. Such problems belong to the field of mathematics called optimization. The next three sections show how the derivative provides an efficient way of solving many optimization problems. Global Maxima and Minima The single greatest (or least) value of a function 푓over a specified domain is called the global maximum (or minimum) of 푓. Recall that the local maxima and minima tell us where a function is locally largest or smallest. Now we are interested in where the function is absolutely largest or smallest in a given domain.

What is the formula for this rule?,"“If Everyone Can Do It, You Can’t Make Money at It”: The Entry and Exit of Firms in the Long Run 415 long run firms can also vary their scale by becoming larger or smaller. The long-run average cost curve shows the lowest cost at which a firm is able to produce a given quantity of output in the long run. So, we would expect that in the long run, compe- tition drives the market price to the minimum point on the typical firm’s long-run average cost curve. The long run in selling produce in farmers’ markets appears to be several years, which is the amount of time it takes for new farmers’ markets to be organized and for farmers to make the investment necessary to sell directly to consumers. As we discussed in the chapter opener, the number of farmers’ markets operating in the United States had increased from 4,093 in 2005 to 7,175 in 2011. By 2011, some farmers had begun to exit the market because the prices they were receiving were lower than they could get by selling their produce elsewhere. In Oregon, 32 of 62 farmers’ markets that had opened in recent years have since closed. Firms in perfectly competitive markets are in a constant struggle to stay one step ahead of their competitors. They are always looking for new ways to provide a product, such as selling carrots in farmers’ markets. It is possible for firms to find ways to earn an economic profit for a while, but competition typically competes those profits away in just a few years. This observation is not restricted to agriculture. In any perfectly competitive market, an opportunity to make economic profits never lasts long. As Sha- ron Oster, an economist at Yale University, has put it, “If everyone can do it, you can’t make money at it.” The Long-Run Supply Curve in a Perfectly Competitive Market If the typical farmer selling carrots in a farmers’ market breaks even at a price of $10 per box, in the long run, the market price will always return to this level. If an increase in demand causes the market price to rise above $10, farmers will be earning economic profits. These profits will attract additional farmers into the market, and the market supply curve will shift to the right until the price is back to $10. Panel (a) in Figure 12.10 illustrates the long-run effect of an increase in demand. An increase in demand from D1 to D2 causes the market price to temporarily rise from $10 per box to $15. At this price, farmers are making economic profits selling carrots at farmers’ markets, but these profits attract entry of new farmers. The result is an increase in sup- ply from S1 to S2, which forces the price back down to $10 per box and eliminates the economic profits. Similarly, if a decrease in demand causes the market price to fall below $10, farm- ers will experience economic losses. These losses will cause some farmers to exit the market, the supply curve will shift to the left, and the price will return to $10. Panel (b) in Figure 12.10 illustrates the long-run effect of a decrease in demand. A decrease in de- mand from D1 to D2 causes the market price to fall temporarily from $10 per box to $7. At this price, farmers are suffering economic losses, but these losses cause some farmers to exit the market for organic apples. The result is a decrease in supply from S1 to S2, which forces the price back up to $10 per box and eliminates the losses.",0.0,-6.107856

The digital environment is not our smartphones, tablets, games consoles, computers or VR headsets, A medium is an environment that has a role in the shaping of human understanding, social interaction and culture When thought of in this way, a Smartphone is a medium because it offers us ways of relating to and interacting with the world - through phone calls, taking images, seeing Images, messaging, recording and viewing video, and so on. Each of these activities has a particular method or way of being done, and this is contingent on the technology and the platforms that we are using. If we are taking images for lnstagram, this will be different from sharing images through WhatsApp and our techniques and understanding of the image will vary accordingly. The Smartphone has fewer restrictions than old media such as newspapers or TV, which did not allow us to create or comment upon media texts in real time. Media as an ecology therefore creates a structure in which media texts are created, In the digital age, that structure allows us to create, share and comment upon media in a fashia that did not exist in the broadcast media era. In addition, digital media allows for the rapid creation, dissemination and reception of texts in a way that was not possible in the past If we consider a platform like TikTok, this was simply inconceivable before the digital age. Firstly, the technology was not there to capture video like that seen on TikTok, and in a form that allowed for instant Sharing. Secondly, the networks of people that receive content on TikTok did not exist. Most critically for this discussion, the inclination to create this kind of text was not there before digital media. The digital environment has created the desire to create and share texts like the ones we see when we scroll on TikTok. Without the structure Of media and structure of culture that the digital gives us, we don't even want to make such content. Pg 96 The structure that digital media gives to culture is therefore critical in how texts are created - and how reality is understood, Anthony Giddens (1984) understood social structures as having two dimensions, There are the rules that are implied or made explicit when social systems are produced and reproduced in media. There are also the ways in which people understand society and culture which are a reflection of those rules The environment therefore affects what we do (rules), and how we do it [our understanding). Digital media is our contemporary environment. We are situated and embedded in that digital media environment, and that shapes our understanding of the world through our engagement with texts. This engagement is not only at the sensory or experiential level, where we continually encounter texts through digital media There is also the symbolic level (Lindgren, 2021), where every medium is constituted by a certain systematic set of rules and codes in the form of vocabulary, grammar and other conventions, All the media we encounter engage us in terms of the senses, but each medium also structures our engagement.",0.0,-6.482795

What is the formula for this rule?,"Use the second derivative to find the location of all local extrema for f(x) = x5 −5x3. Solution To apply the second derivative test, we first need to find critical points c where f′(c) = 0. The derivative is f′(x) = 5x4 −15x2. Therefore, f′(x) = 5x4 −15x2 = 5x2 ⎛ ⎝x2 −3⎞ ⎠= 0 when x = 0, ± 3. To determine whether f has a local extrema at any of these points, we need to evaluate the sign of f′′ at these points. The second derivative is f′′(x) = 20x3 −30x = 10x⎛ ⎝2x2 −3⎞ ⎠. In the following table, we evaluate the second derivative at each of the critical points and use the second derivative test to determine whether f has a local maximum or local minimum at any of these points. x f′′(x) Conclusion −3 −30 3 Local maximum 0 0 Second derivative test is inconclusive 3 30 3 Local minimum By the second derivative test, we conclude that f has a local maximum at x = −3 and f has a local minimum at x = 3. The second derivative test is inconclusive at x = 0. To determine whether f has a local extrema at x = 0, we apply the first derivative test. To evaluate the sign of f′(x) = 5x2 ⎛ ⎝x2 −3⎞ ⎠for x ∈⎛ ⎝−3, 0⎞ ⎠and x ∈⎛ ⎝0, 3⎞ ⎠, let x = −1 and x = 1 be the two test points. Since f′(−1) < 0 and f′(1) < 0, we conclude that f is decreasing on both intervals and, therefore, f does not have a local extrema at x = 0 as shown in the following graph. 406 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",0.0,0.4008038

A simple incremental random tree. distributed random branching factors with mean b. Edge costs are finite, nonnegative, and independently drawn from a common probability distri- bution. The cost of a node is the sum of the edge costs from the root to that node. An optimal goal node is a leaf 'node of minimum cost at depth d. Figure 3.1 shows an example of an incremental random tree, with the numbers on the edges being the edge costs and those in the nodes being the resulting node costs. Note that since edge costs are nonnegative in this model, the node costs are monotonically nondecreasing, in the sense that the cost of a child node is never less than the cost of its parent. The idea of assigning costs to edges can be traced back to the work of Fuller et al. [34] on game-tree search. Two variations of this model are used in the literature, one with a uniform branching factor [67, 144, 153], and the other with a random branching factor [96, 97, 134, 154]. This model is typically suitable for combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem [85], in which an objective function is to be minimized. This model has many important features. First, multiple optimal goal nodes may exist, in contrast to models in which only one optimal goal is allowed [36, 115, 119]. Second, unlike the conventional assumption that the costs of all nodes are independent [36, 115, 119], the costs of two nodes are correlated if they share common edges on their paths to the root, with the degree of dependence based on the number of edges they have in common. Third, the incremental property that the cost of a child node is obtained by adding a value to the cost of its parent represents, in some sense, the way heuristic functions are computed in practice. For example, for sliding-tile puzzles, moving a tile either increases or decreases the Manhattan distance",0.0,-2.031674

What is the formula for ICN3?,"Perfectly Competitive Markets 397 Perfectly Competitive Markets Why are firms in a perfectly competitive market unable to control the prices of the goods they sell, and why are the owners of these firms unable to earn economic profit in the long run? We can begin our analysis by listing the three conditions that make a market perfectly competitive: 1. There must be many buyers and many firms, all of which are small relative to the market. 2. The products sold by all firms in the market must be identical. 3. There must be no barriers to new firms entering the market. All three of these conditions hold in markets for agricultural products. For example, no single consumer or producer of apples buys or sells more than a tiny fraction of the total apple crop. The apples sold by each apple grower are identical, and there are no barriers to a new firm entering the apple market by purchasing land and planting apple trees. As we will see, it is the existence of many firms, all selling the same good, that keeps any single apple farmer from affecting the price of apples. Although the market for apples meets the conditions for perfect competition, the markets for most goods and services do not. In particular, the second and third condi- tions are very restrictive. In most markets that have many buyers and sellers, firms do not sell identical products. For example, not all restaurant meals are the same, nor is all women’s clothing the same. In Chapter 13, we will explore the common situation of mo- nopolistic competition where many firms are selling similar but not identical products. In Chapters 14 and 15, we will analyze industries that are oligopolies or monopolies, where it is difficult for new firms to enter. In this chapter, we concentrate on perfectly competitive markets so we can use them as a benchmark to analyze how firms behave when facing the maximum possible competition. A Perfectly Competitive Firm Cannot Affect the Market Price Prices in perfectly competitive markets are determined by the interaction of demand and supply for the good or service. The actions of any single consumer or any single firm have no effect on the market price. Consumers and firms have to accept the market price if they want to buy and sell in a perfectly competitive market. Because a firm in a perfectly competitive market is very small relative to the market and because it is selling exactly the same product as every other firm, it can sell as much as it wants without having to lower its price. But if a perfectly competitive firm tries to raise its price, it won’t sell anything at all because consumers will switch to buying the product from the firm’s competitors. Therefore, the firm will be a price taker and will have to charge the same price as every other firm in the market. Although we don’t usu- ally think of firms as being too small to affect the market price, consumers are often in the position of being price takers. For instance, suppose your local supermarket is sell- ing bread for $1.50 per loaf. You can load up your shopping cart with 10 loaves of bread, and the supermarket will gladly sell them all to you for $1.50 per loaf. But if you go to the cashier and offer to buy the bread for $1.49 per loaf, he or she will not sell it to you at that price. As a buyer, you are too small relative to the bread market to have any effect on the equilibrium price. Whether you leave the supermarket and buy no bread or you buy 10 loaves, you are unable to change the market price of bread by even 1 cent. The situation you face as a bread buyer is the same one a wheat farmer faces as a wheat seller.",0.0,-9.353367

So far this year, monthly finan- cial obligations of households have fallen to only 16.4 percent of house- hold income, the lowest since 1994. In the second quarter, the percentage of banks reporting increased demand for auto loans was the highest since 2003. Banks began easing lending stan- dards for auto loans, credit cards, and other borrowing this time last year. In the 2011 second quarter the percent- age of loan officers saying they were more willing to make consumer loans rose to the highest level in 17 years. . . . The ebb and flow of bank lend- ing during recessions and recoveries exerts a powerful force on any busi- ness cycle. Aside from this cycle’s problems in mortgage lending, banks are finally beginning to behave as they usually do in a recovery. Barring some new shock, especially from the debt troubles in Washington or Europe, evidence that loan growth is begin- ning to expand in response to easier lending standards and stronger loan demand is a key sign that the recovery has staying power.

Small companies have seen easier terms and conditions in each of the past four quarters. Economists expect to see signs that this loosen- ing in standards is continuing when the Fed issues it third-quarter report from bank senior loan officers in mid-August. More credit is starting to flow to small businesses, as well. That’s im- portant, because small firms account for about half of U.S. job creation, and depend greatly on banks for credit, unlike large corporations that have the option to raise funds in the capi- tal markets by issuing bonds. In the second quarter, the balance of banks reporting stronger vs. weaker demand for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans by small businesses was positive for the first time in five years, accord- ing to the latest Fed survey. Another positive sign is the gradual rise in C&I loans made by small banks, whose customers tend to be small local com- panies. Small-bank C&I loan volume has been rising gradually in 2011 after hitting bottom late last year. Despite increased attention by policymakers over the past year to the dearth of small business lending, the problem has been not so much banks’ unwillingness to lend but sim- ply a lack of loan demand, reflecting weak sales.

What is the formula for 8.27 Verbal paradoxes intrigued Greeks just as much as mathematical ones. The?,"6.1 Since this is the alternating harmonic series, it converges. Thus, the series converges at x = −1. For x = 5, the series is given by ∑ n = 0 ∞ 1 n + 1 = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + ⋯. This is the harmonic series, which is divergent. Therefore, the power series diverges at x = 5. We conclude that the interval of convergence is ⎡ ⎣−1, 5) and the radius of convergence is R = 3. Find the interval and radius of convergence for the series ∑ n = 1 ∞ xn n. Representing Functions as Power Series Being able to represent a function by an “infinite polynomial” is a powerful tool. Polynomial functions are the easiest functions to analyze, since they only involve the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. If we can represent a complicated function by an infinite polynomial, we can use the polynomial representation to differentiate or integrate it. In addition, we can use a truncated version of the polynomial expression to approximate values of the function. So, the question is, when can we represent a function by a power series? Consider again the geometric series (6.3) 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ⋯= ∑ n = 0 ∞ xn. Recall that the geometric series a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + ⋯ converges if and only if |r| < 1. In that case, it converges to a 1 −r. Therefore, if |x| < 1, the series in Example 6.3 converges to 1 1 −x and we write 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ⋯= 1 1 −x for |x| < 1. As a result, we are able to represent the function f(x) = 1 1 −x by the power series 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ⋯when |x| < 1. We now show graphically how this series provides a representation for the function f(x) = 1 1 −x by comparing the graph of f with the graphs of several of the partial sums of this infinite series.

What is the formula for ICN3?,"12.6 • The Solid State: Structure, Properties, and Bonding 383 form an equal number of molecular orbitals (MOs). Figure 12.32 shows the formation of MOs in lithium. To form Li2, each Li atom has four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) that combine to form eight MOs, four bonding and four antibonding. The order of MOs shows 2s-2p mixing (Figure 11.19B). Two more Li atoms form Li4, a slightly larger aggregate, with 16 delocalized MOs. As more Li atoms join the cluster, more MOs are created, and their energy levels lie closer and closer together. Extending this process to 7 g (1 mol) of lithium results in 631023 Li atoms (LiNA) combining to form an extremely large number (4 3 Avogadro’s number) of delocalized MOs. The energies of the MOs are so close that they form a continuum, or band, of MOs. The lower energy MOs are occupied by the 2s1 valence electrons and make up the valence band. The empty MOs that are higher in energy make up the conduction band. In Li metal, the valence band is derived from the 2s AOs, and the conduction band is derived from 2s and mostly 2p AOs. In Li2, two valence electrons fill the lowest energy bonding MO and leave the antibonding MO empty. In Li metal, 1 mol of valence electrons fills the valence band and leaves the conduction band empty. How Band Theory Explains Metallic Properties The key to understanding the properties of metals is that the valence and conduction bands are contiguous, that is, the highest level of one touches the lowest of the other. This means that, given an infinitesimal quantity of energy, electrons jump from the filled valence band to the unfilled conduction band: the electrons are completely delocalized and thus free to move throughout the piece of metal. • Electrical conductivity. Metals conduct so well because an applied field easily excites the highest energy valence electrons into empty conduction orbitals, allow- ing them to move through the sample. • Luster. With so many closely spaced levels available, electrons absorb and release photons of many frequencies as they move between the valence and conduction bands. • Malleability. Under an applied force, layers of positive metal ions move past each other, always protected from mutual repulsions by the delocalized electrons (see Figure 12.31). • Thermal conductivity. When a metal wire is heated, the highest energy electrons are excited and their extra energy is transferred as kinetic energy along the wire’s length.

"What is the formula for 89 False, 푓(푥) =?","During the evolution of physics, scientists have explored ever smaller dimensions, looking deeper into matter in order to examine its elementary building blocks. This general way of learning more about a system by studying its subsystems is called reductionism and has proven a fruitful guiding principle during the last four or five centuries of scientific advancements. Today, we know that atoms are the basic building blocks of matter, although they them- selves are composite particles. The substructure of atoms, however, can be resolved only with accelerators and other tools of modern nuclear and particle physics. For the purposes of this chapter, it is reasonable to view atoms as the elementary building blocks. In fact, the word atom comes from the Greek atomos, which means “indivisible.” The diameter of an atom is about 10–10 m = 0.1 nm. This distance is often called an angstrom (Å). The simplest atom is hydrogen, composed of a proton and an electron. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. The next most abundant element is helium. Helium has two protons and two neutrons in its nucleus, along with two electrons surrounding the nucleus. Another common atom is oxygen, with eight protons and eight electrons, as well as (usually) eight neutrons. The heaviest naturally occurring atom is uranium, with 92 protons, 92 electrons, and usually 146 neutrons. So far, 118 different elements have been recognized and classified in the periodic table of the elements. Essentially all of the hydrogen in the universe, along with some helium, was produced in the Big Bang about 13.7 billion years ago. Heavier elements, up to iron, were and still are produced in stars. Elements with more protons and neutrons than iron (gold, mercury, lead, and so forth) are thought to have been produced by supernova explosions. Most of the atoms of the elements on Earth were produced more than 5 billion years ago, probably in a supernova explosion, and have been recycled ever since. Even our bodies are composed of atoms from the ashes of a dying star. (The production and recycling of the elements will be covered in detail in Chapters 39 and 40.) Consider the number of atoms in 12 g of the most common isotope of carbon, 12C, where 12 represents the atomic mass number—that is, the total number of protons (six) plus neutrons (six) in the carbon nucleus. This number of atoms has been measured to be 6.022 · 1023, which is called Avogadro’s number, NA: NA =6 022 1023 . . ⋅ To get a feeling for how much carbon corresponds to NA atoms, consider two forms of carbon: diamond and graphite. Diamonds are composed of carbon atoms arranged in a crystal lattice, whereas the carbon atoms in graphite are arranged in two-dimensional layers (Figure 13.2). In the diamond structure, carbon atoms are bonded in an interlocking lattice, which makes dia- mond very hard and transparent to light. In graphite, carbon atoms are arranged in layers that ■ ■ The atom is the basic building block of macroscopic matter. ■ ■ The diameter of an atom is approximately 10–10 m. ■ ■ Matter can exist as a gas, a liquid, or a solid.",0.0,-5.737793

What is the formula for this rule?,"For the electromagnetic wave represented in Figure 31.5, the electric field always points along the y-axis. The direction in which the wave is traveling is the positive x-direction, so the electric field of the electromagnetic wave lies within a plane of oscillation (Figure 31.17). We can visualize the polarization of an electromagnetic wave by looking at the electric field vector of the wave in the yz-plane, which is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave is traveling (Figure 31.18a). The electric field vector changes from the positive y-direction to the negative y-direction and back again as the wave travels. The electric field of the wave oscillates in the y-direction only, never changing its orientation. This type of wave is called a plane-polarized wave in the y-direction. The electromagnetic waves making up the light emitted by most common light sources, such as the Sun or an incandes- cent light bulb, have random polarizations. Each wave has its electric field vector oscillating in a different plane. Such light is called unpolarized light. Light from an unpolarized source can be represented by many vectors like the ones shown in Figure 31.18a, but with random orientations (Figure 31.18b). Unpolarized light can also be represented by summing the y-components and the z-components separately to produce the net y- and z-components. Unpolarized light has equal com- ponents in the y- and z-directions (Figure 31.19a). If there is less net polarization in the y-direction than in the z-direction, then the light is said to be partially polarized in the z-direction (Figure 31.19b). Unpolarized light can be transformed to polarized light by passing the unpolarized light through a polarizer. A polar- izer allows only one component of the electric field vectors of the light waves to pass through. One way to make a polarizer is to produce a material that consists of long par- allel chains of molecules. This discussion will not go into the details of the molecular structure but will simply characterize each polarizer by a polarizing direction. Unpo- larized light passing through a polarizer emerges polarized in the polarizing direc- tion (Figure 31.20). The components of the light that have the same direction as the polarizer are transmitted, but the components of the light that are perpendicular to the polarizer are absorbed. Now let’s consider the intensity of the light that passes through a polarizer. Unpolarized light with intensity I0 has equal components in the y- and z-directions. After passing through Figure 31.17 ​ An electromagnetic wave with the plane of oscillation of the electric field shown in pink. z y x E B Figure 31.18 ​ (a) Electric field vectors in the yz-plane, defining the plane of polarization to be the xy-plane.

What is the formula for FIGURE 7?,"Colorings of C5 and C6. the third vertex can be colored red, the fourth vertex blue, and the fifth vertex red. Finally, the sixth vertex, which is adjacent to the first, can be colored blue. Hence, the chromatic number of C6 is 2. Figure 7 displays the coloring constructed here. Next, let n = 5 and consider C5. Pick a vertex and color it red. Proceeding clockwise, it is necessary to assign a second color, say blue, to the next vertex reached. Continuing in the clockwise direction, the third vertex can be colored red, and the fourth vertex can be colored blue. The fifth vertex cannot be colored either red or blue, because it is adjacent to the fourth vertex and the first vertex. Consequently, a third color is required for this vertex. Thus, the chromatic number of C5 is 3. A coloring of C5 using three colors is displayed in Figure 7. In general, two colors are needed to color Cn when n is even. To construct such a coloring, simply pick a vertex and color it red. Proceed around the graph in a clockwise direction (us- ing a planar representation of the graph) coloring the second vertex blue, the third vertex red, and so on. The nth vertex can be colored blue, because the two vertices adjacent to it, namely the(n −1)st and the first vertices, are both colored red. When n is odd and n > 1, the chromatic number of Cn is 3. To see this, pick an initial vertex. To use only two colors, it is necessary to alternate colors as the graph is traversed in a clockwise direction. However, the nth vertex reached is adjacent to two vertices of different colors, namely, the first and (n −1)st. Hence, a third color must be used. We have shown that χ(Cn) = 2 if n is an even positive integer with n ≥4 and χ(Cn) = 3 if n is an odd positive integer with n ≥3. ◂ The best algorithms known for finding the chromatic number of a graph have exponential Links worst-case time complexity (in the number of vertices of the graph). Even the problem of finding an approximation to the chromatic number of a graph is difficult. It has been shown that if there were an algorithm with polynomial worst-case time complexity that could approximate the chromatic number of a graph up to a factor of 2 (that is, construct a bound that was no more than double the chromatic number of the graph), then an algorithm with polynomial worst- case time complexity for finding the chromatic number of the graph would also exist. 10.8.2 Applications of Graph Colorings Graph coloring has a variety of applications to problems involving scheduling and assignments. (Note that because no efficient algorithm is known for graph coloring, this does not lead to efficient algorithms for scheduling and assignments.) Examples of such applications will be given here. The first application deals with the scheduling of final exams.",1.0,4.347123

What is the formula for ICN3?,"6.37 d dxln(xr) = rxr −1 xr = r x. Furthermore, d dx(r ln x) = r x. Since the derivatives of these two functions are the same, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, they must differ by a constant. So we have ln(xr) = r ln x + C for some constant C. Taking x = 1, we get ln(1r) = r ln(1) + C 0 = r(0) + C C = 0. Thus ln(xr) = r ln x and the proof is complete. Note that we can extend this property to irrational values of r later in this section. Part iii. follows from parts ii. and iv. and the proof is left to you. □ Example 6.37 Using Properties of Logarithms Use properties of logarithms to simplify the following expression into a single logarithm: ln 9 −2 ln 3 + ln⎛ ⎝1 3 ⎞ ⎠.

(Also, see the preamble to Exercise 46 in the Supplmentary Exercises of Chapter 3.) That is, they may produce a Hamilton circuit with total weight W′ such that W ≤W′ ≤cW, where W is the total length of an exact solution and c is a constant. For example, there is an algorithm with polynomial worst-case time complexity that works if the weighted graph satisfies the triangle inequality such that c = 3∕2. For general weighted graphs for every positive real number k no algorithm is known that will always produce a solution at most k times a best solution. If such an algorithm existed, this would show that the class P would be the same as the class NP, perhaps the most famous open question about the complexity of algorithms (see Section 3.3). In practice, algorithms have been developed that can solve traveling salesperson problems with as many as 1000 vertices within 2% of an exact solution using only a few minutes of com- puter time.

(12.25) It is important to note that equations 12.23 through 12.25 all hold for any orbital radius. For an elliptical orbit with a semimajor axis a, obtaining the energy of the satellite requires a little more mathematics. The result is very similar to equation 12.24, with the radius r of the circular orbit replaced by the semimajor axis a of the elliptical orbit: E G M m a = E – . 1 2 Orbit of Geostationary Satellites For many applications, a satellite needs to remain at the same point in the sky. For example, a satellite TV dish always points to the same place in the sky, and a satellite has to be located there to ensure that the dish can receive a signal. Satellites that are continuously at the same point in the sky are said to be geostationary. What are the conditions that a satellite must fulfill to be geostationary? First, it has to move in a circle, because this is the only orbit that has a constant angular velocity. Second, the period of rotation must match that of the Earth’s, exactly 1 day. And third, the axis of rotation of the satellite’s orbit must be exactly aligned with that of the Earth’s rotation. Because the center of the Earth must be at the center of a circular orbit for any satellite, the only possible geostationary orbit is one exactly above the Equator. These conditions leave only the radius of the orbit to be determined. To find the radius, we use Kepler’s Third Law in the form of equation 12.19 and solve for r: T r GM r GMT 2 3 2 2 2 1 3 4 4 = =   ⇒               / .

In fact, probably within your reach right now are a laptop computer, MP3 player, cell phone, and/or wristwatch, which represent one type of applica- tion. Metal-plated jewelry and silverware represent the other. These are a few of the objects you use every day that rely on a major field in applied thermodynamics— electrochemistry, the study of the relationship between chemical change and electrical work. We typically study this relationship with electrochemical cells, systems that incorporate a redox reaction to produce or utilize electrical energy. In this chapter, we examine the essential features of the two types of electrochemical cells as well as the quantitative relationship between free energy and electrical work. 21.1 •  redox Reactions and Electrochemical Cells To begin, we review the oxidation-reduction process and describe the half-reaction method of balancing redox reactions. Then we see how redox reactions are used in the two types of electrochemical cells. A Quick Review of Oxidation-Reduction Concepts All electrochemical processes involve the movement of electrons from one chemical species to another in an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction. In any redox process, • Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. Oxidation and reduction occur simultaneously. • The oxidizing agent does the oxidizing by taking electrons from the substance being oxidized. The reducing agent does the reducing by giving electrons to the substance being reduced. • Therefore, the oxidizing agent is reduced, and the reducing agent is oxidized. • The oxidized substance ends up with a higher (more positive or less negative) oxidation number (O.N.), and the reduced substance ends up with a lower (less positive or more negative) O.N. • The total number of electrons gained by the atoms/ions of the oxidizing agent equals the total number lost by the atoms/ions of the reducing agent. Figure 21.1 presents these ideas for the aqueous reaction between zinc metal and a strong acid. Be sure you can identify the oxidation and reduction parts of a redox process.

Solution We want a formula expressing 푡as a function of 푃. Take logs: log 푃= log(15.141(1.03)푡). Since log(퐴퐵) = log 퐴+ log 퐵, we have log 푃= log 15.141 + log((1.03)푡). Now use log(퐴푡) = 푡log 퐴: log 푃= log 15.141 + 푡log 1.03. Solve for 푡in two steps, using a calculator at the final stage: 푡log 1.03 = log 푃−log 15.141 푡= log 푃 log 1.03 −log 15.141 log 1.03 = 77.8985 log푃−91.9322. Thus, 푓−1(푃) = 77.8985 log푃−91.9322.

Since the odd terms and the even terms in the sequence of partial sums converge to the same limit S, it can be shown that the sequence of partial sums converges to S, and therefore the alternating harmonic series converges to S.

What is the formula for II3I3UCU30Y?,"respectable. But there were other forms of consulting the gods or invoking supernatural powers which were less above board. These tended in particular to involve the powers not of the gods but of the dead. There was an oracle of the dead in north-west Greece, supposedly at the entrance to Hadés, and Odysseus sacrificed and called up the dead in Odyssey 11 to discover his future. In classical Athens, the chief way in which the powers of the dead were enlisted was by depositing curse tablets in graves, particularly the graves of those who had died young. These were thought to wander the earth until their ‘proper’ time had come to die. Other favoured locations were thought to be ‘in touch’ with chthonic (underground) powers (c.g. wells). These tablets, which are generally inscribed lead, regularly sought to ‘bind’ those they cursed, leaving them helpless; they were sometimes accompanied by figurines. Surviving Athenian examples include curses on directors of plays (didaskaloi) and on actors, on rivals in love and on opponents in law-courts. The also include curses aimed at whole groups of people which reveal no clear motivation, The earliest of all examples, dating to the end of the fifth century may be the following: (I bind] Lysanias the blower from the silver works — him and his wife and possessions and whatever work he produces and his possessions and hands and feet and mind and head and nose... curse... of the sacred earth. The line between acceptable and unacceptable use of such curses seems to have been a fine one. The Athenian ekk/ésia went in for ritual curses against would- be traitors, for example, and oaths might be accompanied by wax models to whose fate those swearing the oath linked their own.

What is the formula for 26.1 Kirchhoff’s Rules?,"The debt-to-assets ratio compares total liabilities to total assets. It is usually calculated to three decimal places and can be expressed as a percentage by multiplying by 100. This ratio indicates the proportion of total assets financed by liabilities. It’s important to know this ratio because liabilities have to be repaid whether or not a company is doing well financially. If assets are financed mainly by debt, rather than equity, then this ratio will be high, which would suggest the company has adopted a risky financing strategy. What makes this a risky financing strategy is the possibility the company will not be able to generate enough money from its debt-financed business to cover the interest charged on its debt. If this occurs over several periods, causing the company to default on its payments, the company can be forced into bankruptcy. Hostess suffered this fate twice before the Twinkies company decreased its debt load. The balance sheet of General Mills, in Exhibit 10.1, reports total liabilities of $22,200 and total assets of $30,110. Thus, the debt-to-assets ratio is $22,200 ÷ $30,110 = 0.737, or 73.7 percent.

But as they became less worried that the Spartans might march in again to enforce the conditions, the Athenians began to look back with some anger. In the year 399 a number of trials took | place, all of which have something to do with those linked with the Thirty. The most notorious of these is the trial of the philosopher Sdkratés, He was brought to court on a charge of ‘refusing to recognise the gods of the state and introducing other new gods. He is also guilty of corrupting the youth’ (Xenoph6én, Memorabilia 1.1.1). Half a century later Aiskhinés would state. as if it were a matter of general knowledge: ‘Athenians, you executed the sophist Sdkratés because he had quite clearly been the teacher of Kritias. who was one of the Thirty who put an end to democracy’ (Aiskhinés, 1.173). Since Athenian jurors voted immediately after hearing the evidence but without discussing the issues among themselves, no one can have known. even at the time, what motivated his condemnation, but it would be foolish to rule political motivation in or out. On the one hand, Sdkratés had not only loyally fulfilled the duties of a citizen of the democracy, serving as a hoplite and on the boule, he had even on one notable occasion refused to co-operate with the Thirty in helping to arrest a rich metic. But in the unsettled cir- cumstances after the end of the war (had the gods deserted Athens”), the reli- fious charges were serious in themselves, When Sdkratés was found puilty, he took a high moral stance, refusing the opportunity to have his sentence commuted to a heavy fine. He was condemned to drink hemlock, and died in the dignified manner which was to be an example to generations of martyrs. The killing of their master and guide inspired in his followers like the philosopher Plato a hatred for the democratic system. However, it is difficult to see Sokratés as the victim of the democratic system as such. What the case did show was how profoundly sensitive the Athenian democracy could be at difficult times to innovation and change, and how politics per- vaded the whole of Athenian life.",0.0,-4.1022196
What is the formula for S-88?,"16.5 • Theories of Chemical Kinetics 519 Summary of Section 16.4 •  Integrated rate laws are used to find either the time needed to reach a certain concentration of reactant or the concentration present after a given time. •  Rearrangements of the integrated rate laws that give equations in the form of a straight line allow us to determine reaction orders and rate constants graphically. •  The half-life is the time needed for the reactant concentration to reach half its initial value; for first-order reactions, the half-life is constant—that is, it is independent of concentration. 16.5 •  Theories of Chemical Kinetics As was pointed out at the beginning of the chapter, concentration and temperature have major effects on reaction rate. Chemists employ two models—collision theory and transition state theory—to explain these effects. Collision Theory: Basis of the Rate Law The basic tenet of collision theory is that particles—atoms, molecules, or ions—must collide to react. But number of collisions can’t be the only factor determining rate, or all reactions would be over in an instant. For example, at 1 atm and 208C, the N2 and O2 molecules in 1 mL of air experience about 1027 collisions per second. If all that was needed for a reaction to occur was an N2 molecule colliding with an O2 molecule, our atmosphere would consist almost entirely of NO; in fact, only traces are present. Thus, this theory also relies on the concepts of collision energy and molecular structure to explain the effects of concentration and temperature on rate. Why Concentrations Are Multiplied in the Rate Law Particles must collide to react, and the laws of probability tell us that the number of collisions depends on the product of the numbers of reactant particles, not their sum. Suppose we have only two particles of A and two of B confined in a reaction vessel. Figure 16.9 shows that four A-B collisions are possible. When we add another particle of A, six A-B col- lisions (3 3 2) are possible, not just five (3 1 2). Similarly, when we add another particle of B, nine A-B collisions (3 3 3) are possible, not just six (3 1 3). Thus, collision theory explains why we multiply the concentrations in the rate law to obtain the observed rate. The Effect of T emperature on the Rate Constant and the Rate Temperature typically has a dramatic effect on reaction rate: for many reactions near room tem- perature, an increase of 10 K (108C) doubles or triples the rate. Figure 16.10A shows kinetic data for an organic reaction—hydrolysis, or reaction with water, of the ester ethyl acetate. To understand the effect of temperature, we measure concentrations and times for the reaction run at different temperatures. Solving each rate expression for k and plotting the results (Figure 16.10B), we find that k increases exponentially as T increases. These results are consistent with findings obtained in 1889 by the Swedish chem- ist Svante Arrhenius.",0.0,-6.9087734

Then you'Il get a notification to tell you to get out there and walk' PQ. 178 While there are several companies in this digital fitness space, it is important to note that these are all the same kind of companies: companies that own data, As Christopher Till explains: When fitness tracking app Moves was purchased by Facebook in April 2014. they announced that their data would not be 'oommingied' with one another Within two weeks of the purchase, they changed their terms of service and privacy policy to state that they vIII share data with Facebook and their other afhlzates (2014: 449) So, the companies that are involved in helping us stay fit are also actively involved in trading the data that we produce to other data-intensive companies. This means that when we use digital self-tracking devices, what is occurring is the transformation of individual health activities into quantified forms of data that are ripe for the extraction of value (Till, 2014: 451). The quantification of exercise is not something that just occurred as self-tracking technologies began to emerge (Lupton, 2016). The monitoring of one's physical performance across a range of metrics is a feature of many fitness programmes, which are often employed to improve performance. However, the frictionless nature of digital devices for this purpose has changed the scope and scale of self-tracking. Wearing a fitness tracker or smart watch makes the task of keeping track of activity far easier than filling in a wallchart or keeping a detailed journal. Given that this data can also be visualised in interesting ways to compare past performance and track progress, then it's easy to see why this is attractive. Digital tracking devices and applications can record granular information about the body during physical exercise that exceeds manual documenting of activity, We are not the only beneficiaries though. The benefits to corporations are, however, of a completely different order: the commodification of exercise activity (Till, 2014: 4511, Figure 12.2 A smart watch - a key device in the quantified sell Source MaurlzlcJ Pesce. htlpsjlcommons wlklmedla org»'wlkl»'FIle Androld_Wear Smartwatch- LG G Watch %2815051??4155%291pg While sporting companies have always sold equipment and related paraphernalia, whether consumers used this equipment did not really matter because this was not where the money was being made. In other words, once the equipment had been sold, the application of the equipment became largely insignificant, If you bought a tennis racquet but never played tennis - who cared? Not the company that made the racquet, as they had already been paid, Pg we The great difference today is that when exercise activities are quantified into data, corporations can use the associated data in order to extract surplus value (Till, 2014: 451) So, digital self-tracking has changed the value of fitness and exercise. Suddenly, some sporting activities can produce data that is considered more valuable than previous anticipated (Till, 2014).",0.0,-6.6977797

What is the formula for this rule?,"added when its par- ent, say u, was being processed. We must show that v is at the lowest (bottom-most, i.e., numerically greatest) level of the tree. Suppose not; say vertex x, whose parent is vertex w, is at a lower level. Then w is at a lower level than u. Clearly v must be a leaf, because any child of v could not have been seen before v is seen. Consider the tree T′ obtained from T by deleting v. By the inductive hypothesis, the vertices in T′ must be processed in order of their level in T′ (which is the same as their level in T, and the absence of v in T′ has no effect on the rest of the algorithm). Therefore, u must have been processed before w, and therefore v would have joined the waiting list before x did, a contradiction. Therefore, v is at the bottom- most level of the tree, and the proof is complete. 49. We modify the pseudocode given in Algorithm 2 by initializing m to be 0 at the beginning of the algorithm, and adding the statements “m := m + 1” and “assign m to vertex v” after the statement that removes vertex v from L. 51. If a directed edge uv is not followed while we are processing its tail u dur- ing the depth-first search process, then it must be the case that its head v had already been visited. There are three cases. If vertex v was visited after we started processing u, then, be- cause we are not finished processing u yet, v must appear in the subtree rooted at u (and hence, must be a descendant of u), so we have a forward edge. Otherwise, the processing of v must have already begun before we started processing u. If it had not yet finished (i.e., we are still forming the subtree rooted at v), then u is a descendant of v, and hence, v is an ances- tor of u (we have a back edge). Finally, if the processing of v had already finished, then by definition we have a cross edge. 53. Let T be the spanning tree constructed in Figure 3 and T1, T2, T3, and T4 the spanning trees in Figure 4. Denote by d(T′, T′′) the distance between T′ and T′′.

Then T2 ∪{e1} contains a simple circuit C containing e1. The graph T1 −{e1} has two connected components; the endpoints of e1 are in different components. Travel C from u in the direction opposite to e1 until you come to the first vertex in the same component as v. The edge just crossed is e2. Clearly, T2 ∪{e1} −{e2} is a tree, because e2 was on C. Also T1 −{e1} ∪{e2} is a tree, because e2 reunited the two components.",0.0,-2.0257735
What is the formula for this rule?,"Use resolution to show that the hypotheses “Jasmine is skiing or it is not snowing” and “It is snowing or Bart is playing hockey” imply that “Jasmine is skiing or Bart is playing hockey.” Solution: Let p be the proposition “It is snowing,” q the proposition “Jasmine is skiing,” and r the proposition “Bart is playing hockey.” We can represent the hypotheses as ¬p ∨q and p ∨ Extra Examples r, respectively. Using resolution, the proposition q ∨r, “Jasmine is skiing or Bart is playing hockey,” follows. ◂ Resolution plays an important role in programming languages based on the rules of logic, such as Prolog (where resolution rules for quantified statements are applied). Furthermore, it can be used to build automatic theorem proving systems. To construct proofs in propositional logic using resolution as the only rule of inference, the hypotheses and the conclusion must be expressed as clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of variables or negations of these variables. We can replace a statement in propositional logic that is not a clause by one or more equivalent statements that are clauses. For example, suppose we have a statement of the form p ∨(q ∧r). Because p ∨(q ∧r) ≡(p ∨q) ∧(p ∨r), we can replace the single statement p ∨(q ∧r) by two statements p ∨q and p ∨r, each of which is a clause. We can replace a statement of the form ¬(p ∨q) by the two statements ¬p and ¬q because De Morgan’s law tells us that ¬(p ∨q) ≡ ¬p ∧¬q. We can also replace a conditional statement p →q with the equivalent disjunction ¬p ∨q.",0.0,-1.4513867

State the COROLLARY 1.,"The number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm to sort n elements based on binary comparisons is Ω(n log n). A consequence of Corollary 1 is that a sorting algorithm based on binary comparisons that uses Θ(n log n) comparisons, in the worst case, to sort n elements is optimal, in the sense that no other such algorithm has better worst-case complexity. Note that by Theorem 1 in Section 5.4 we see that the merge sort algorithm is optimal in this sense. We can also establish a similar result for the average-case complexity of sorting algorithms. The average number of comparisons used by a sorting algorithm based on binary comparisons is the average depth of a leaf in the decision tree representing the sorting algorithm. By Exer- cise 48 in Section 11.1 we know that the average depth of a leaf in a binary tree with N vertices is Ω(log N). We obtain the following estimate when we let N = n! and note that a function that is Ω(log n!) is also Ω(n log n) because log n! is Θ(n log n).",1.0,5.207155

Draw a circle representing a unit volume of the solution after each of these changes: (a) For every 1 mL of solution, 1 mL of solvent is added. (b) One-third of the solvent is boiled off. Plan ​ Given the starting solution, we have to find the number of solute particles in a unit volume after each change. The number of particles per unit volume, N, is directly related to the number of moles per unit volume, M, so we can use a relationship similar to Equation 3.10 to find the number of particles. (a) The volume increases, so the final solution is more dilute—fewer particles per unit volume. (b) Some solvent is lost, so the final solution is more concentrated—more particles per unit volume.

Prepare the adjusting journal entry that is required on December 31. 3. Show how Accounts Receivable would be reported on the balance sheet at December 31. 4. If the balances for CT&T, NewTel, and Telemedia at the end of November continued to exist at the end of December (in the over-120-days category), what balance would you have esti mated for the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts on December 31? Would this have changed MCI’s net income in the current year? Explain. 5. A few days later, you overhear Mr. Pavlo talking about the accounts receivable from Hi-Rim. Apparently, MCI will soon loan Hi-Rim some money, creating notes receivable. Hi-Rim will use the money to pay off the Accounts Receivable balance it owes to MCI. You are aware that Mr. Pavlo receives a bonus based on MCI’s net income. Should you investigate this matter further? Explain why or why not. Epilogue: The events described above are based on an article in the June 10, 2002, issue of Forbes magazine that describes how Walter Pavlo was pressured to commit accounting fraud at MCI.

What is the formula for 266 Chapter 8 • Electron Configuration and Chemical Periodicity?,"618 C H A P T E R 1 8 Macroeconomics in an Open Economy and the value of the dollar rises against the yen to ¥ 140 = +1, the speculator will be able to exchange $5,000,000 for ¥ 700,000,000 (=+5,000,000 * ¥ 140), for a profit of ¥100,000,000. To summarize, the demand curve for dollars shifts to the right when incomes in Japan rise, when interest rates in the United States rise, or when speculators decide that the value of the dollar will rise relative to the value of the yen. During a recession in Japan, Japanese incomes will fall, reducing the demand for U.S.-produced goods and services and shifting the demand curve for dollars to the left. Similarly, if interest rates in the United States fall, the desirability of investing in U.S. financial assets will decrease, and the demand curve for dollars will shift to the left. Finally, if speculators become convinced that the future value of the dollar will be lower than its current value, the demand for dollars will fall, and the demand curve will shift to the left. Shifts in the Supply of Foreign Exchange The factors that affect the sup- ply curve for dollars are similar to those that affect the demand curve for dollars. An economic expansion in the United States increases the incomes of Americans and increases their demand for goods and services, including goods and services made in Japan. As U.S. consumers and firms increase their spending on Japanese products, they must supply dollars in exchange for yen, which causes the supply curve for dollars to shift to the right. Similarly, an increase in interest rates in Japan will make financial investments in Japan more attractive to U.S. investors. These higher Japanese interest rates will cause the supply of dollars to shift to the right, as U.S. investors exchange dol- lars for yen. Finally, if speculators become convinced that the future value of the yen will be higher relative to the dollar than it is today, the supply curve of dollars will shift to the right as traders attempt to exchange dollars for yen. A recession in the United States will decrease the demand for Japanese products and cause the supply curve for dollars to shift to the left. Similarly, a decrease in interest rates in Japan will make financial investments in Japan less attractive and cause the supply curve of dollars to shift to the left. If traders become convinced that the future value of the yen will be lower relative to the dollar, the supply curve will also shift to the left. Adjustment to a New Equilibrium The factors that affect the demand and supply for currencies are constantly changing. Whether the exchange rate increases or decreases depends on the direction and size of the shifts in the demand curve and supply curve. For example, as Figure 18.3 shows, if the demand curve for dollars in exchange for Japanese yen shifts to the right by more than the supply curve shifts, the equilibrium exchange rate will increase. Figure 18.3 Shifts in the Demand and Supply Curve Resulting in a Higher Exchange Rate Holding other factors constant, an increase in the supply of dollars will decrease the equilibrium exchange rate. An increase in the demand for dollars will increase the equilibrium exchange rate. In the case shown in this figure, the demand curve and the supply curve have both shifted to the right. Because the demand curve has shifted to the right by more than the supply curve, the equilibrium exchange rate has increased from ¥120 to $1 at point A to ¥130 to $1 at point B. 0 Exchange rate (¥/$) Quantity of dollars traded ¥130 D1 A B D2 S2 S1 120",0.0,-9.222998
What is the formula for this rule?,"Figure 1.18 (a) For any even integer n, f(x) = axn is an even function. (b) For any odd integer n, f(x) = axn is an odd function. Behavior at Infinity To determine the behavior of a function f as the inputs approach infinity, we look at the values f(x) as the inputs, x, become larger. For some functions, the values of f(x) approach a finite number. For example, for the function f(x) = 2 + 1/x, the values 1/x become closer and closer to zero for all values of x as they get larger and larger. For this function, we say “f(x) approaches two as x goes to infinity,” and we write f(x) →2 as x →∞. The line y = 2 is a horizontal asymptote for the function f(x) = 2 + 1/x because the graph of the function gets closer to the line as x gets larger. For other functions, the values f(x) may not approach a finite number but instead may become larger for all values of x as they get larger. In that case, we say “f(x) approaches infinity as x approaches infinity,” and we write f(x) →∞as x →∞. For example, for the function f(x) = 3x2, the outputs f(x) become larger as the inputs x get larger. We can conclude that the function f(x) = 3x2 approaches infinity as x approaches infinity, and we write 3x2 →∞as x →∞. The behavior as x →−∞and the meaning of f(x) →−∞as x →∞or x →−∞can be defined similarly. We can describe what happens to the values of f(x) as x →∞and as x →−∞as the end behavior of the function. To understand the end behavior for polynomial functions, we can focus on quadratic and cubic functions. The behavior for higher-degree polynomials can be analyzed similarly. Consider a quadratic function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c. If a > 0, the values f(x) →∞as x →±∞. If a < 0, the values f(x) →−∞as x →±∞. Since the graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, the parabola opens upward if a > 0; the parabola opens downward if a < 0. (See Figure 1.19(a).) Now consider a cubic function f(x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. If a > 0, then f(x) →∞as x →∞and f(x) →−∞ as x →−∞. If a < 0, then f(x) →−∞as x →∞and f(x) →∞as x →−∞. As we can see from both of these graphs, the leading term of the polynomial determines the end behavior. (See Figure 1.19(b).) Chapter 1 | Functions and Graphs 41",1.0,1.0216706
What is the formula for this rule?,"If the money is compounded 2 times per year, the amount of money after half a year is A⎛ ⎝1 2 ⎞ ⎠= P + ⎛ ⎝r 2 ⎞ ⎠P = P⎛ ⎝1 + ⎛ ⎝r 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎞ ⎠. The amount of money after 1 year is A(1) = A⎛ ⎝1 2 ⎞ ⎠+ ⎛ ⎝r 2 ⎞ ⎠A⎛ ⎝1 2 ⎞ ⎠= P⎛ ⎝1 + r 2 ⎞ ⎠+ r 2 ⎛ ⎝P⎛ ⎝1 + r 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎞ ⎠= P⎛ ⎝1 + r 2 ⎞ ⎠ 2 . After t years, the amount of money in the account is A(t) = P⎛ ⎝1 + r 2 ⎞ ⎠ 2t . More generally, if the money is compounded n times per year, the amount of money in the account after t years is given by the function A(t) = P⎛ ⎝1 + r n ⎞ ⎠ nt. What happens as n →∞? To answer this question, we let m = n/r and write ⎛ ⎝1 + r n ⎞ ⎠ nt = ⎛ ⎝1 + 1 m ⎞ ⎠ mrt , and examine the behavior of (1 + 1/m)m as m →∞, using a table of values (Table 1.12). m 10 100 1000 10,000 100,000 1,000,000 ⎛ ⎝1 + 1 m ⎞ ⎠ m 2.5937 2.7048 2.71692 2.71815 2.718268 2.718280 Table 1.12 Values of ⎛ ⎝1 + 1 m ⎞ ⎠ m as m →∞ Looking at this table, it appears that (1 + 1/m)m is approaching a number between 2.7 and 2.8 as m →∞. In fact, (1 + 1/m)m does approach some number as m →∞. We call this number e . To six decimal places of accuracy, e ≈2.718282. The letter e was first used to represent this number by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler during the 1720s. Although Euler did not discover the number, he showed many important connections between e and logarithmic functions. We still use the notation e today to honor Euler’s work because it appears in many areas of mathematics and because we can use it in many practical applications. Returning to our savings account example, we can conclude that if a person puts P dollars in an account at an annual interest rate r, compounded continuously, then A(t) = Pert. This function may be familiar. Since functions involving base e arise often in applications, we call the function f(x) = ex the natural exponential function. Not only is this function interesting because of the definition of the number e, but also, as discussed next, its graph has an important property.",1.0,1.0711658
What is the formula for this rule?,"340 5 / Induction and Recursion Solution: To prove this formula using mathematical induction, let P(n) be the statement that the sum of the first n + 1 terms of a geometric progression in this formula is correct. BASIS STEP: P(0) is true, because ar0+1 −a r −1 = ar −a r −1 = a(r −1) r −1 = a. INDUCTIVE STEP: The inductive hypothesis is the statement that P(k) is true, where k is an arbitrary nonnegative integer. That is, P(k) is the statement that a + ar + ar2 + ⋯+ ark = ark+1 −a r −1 . To complete the inductive step we must show that if P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) is also true. To show that this is the case, we first add ark+1 to both sides of the equality asserted by P(k). We find that a + ar + ar2 + ⋯+ ark + ark+1 IH = ark+1 −a r −1 + ark+1. Rewriting the right-hand side of this equation shows that ark+1 −a r −1 + ark+1 = ark+1 −a r −1 + ark+2 −ark+1 r −1 = ark+2 −a r −1 . Combining these last two equations gives a + ar + ar2 + ⋯+ ark + ark+1 = ark+2 −a r −1 . This shows that if the inductive hypothesis P(k) is true, then P(k + 1) must also be true. This completes the inductive argument. We have completed the basis step and the inductive step, so by mathematical induction P(n) is true for all nonnegative integers n. This shows that the formula for the sum of the terms of a geometric series is correct. ◂ As previously mentioned, the formula in Example 3 is the case of the formula in Example 4 with a = 1 and r = 2.

What is the formula for 3.6 THE CHAIN RULE AND INVERSE FUNCTIONS?,"Oops, sorry, our mistake Once the Italian segment of the Psyop had done the job it was designed to do a very different story emerged. Italian authorities revealed that 99 percent of those who had ‘died from Covid-19’ in Italy had one, two, three, or more ‘co-morbidities’ or illnesses and health problems that could have ended their life. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a figure of 94 percent for Americans dying of ‘Covid’ while having other serious medical conditions – on average two to three (some five or six) other potential causes of death. In terms of death from an unproven ‘virus’ I say it is 100 percent. The other one percent in Italy and six percent in the US would presumably have died from ‘Covid’s’ flu-like symptoms with a range of other possible causes in conjunction with a test not testing for the ‘virus’. Fox News reported that even more startling figures had emerged in one US county in which 410 of 422 deaths aĴributed to ‘Covid-19’ had other potentially deadly health conditions. The Italian National Health Institute said later that the average age of people dying with a ‘Covid-19’ diagnosis in Italy was about 81. Ninety percent were over 70 with ten percent over 90. In terms of other reasons to die some 80 percent had two or more chronic diseases with half having three or more including cardiovascular problems, diabetes, respiratory problems and cancer. Why is the phantom ‘Covid-19’ said to kill overwhelmingly old people and hardly affect the young? Old people continually die of many causes and especially respiratory disease which you can re- diagnose ‘Covid-19’ while young people die in tiny numbers by comparison and rarely of respiratory disease. Old people ‘die of Covid’ because they die of other things that can be redesignated ‘Covid’ and it really is that simple. Flu has flown The blueprint was in place.

We will prove that a(n) is a natural number and a(n) ≤n. This is true for the base case n = 0 because a(0) = 0. Now assume that a(n−1) is a natural number and a(n−1) ≤n−1. Then a(a(n −1)) is a applied to a natural number less than or equal to n −1. Hence, a(a(n −1)) is also a natural num- ber less than or equal to n −1. Therefore, n −a(a(n −1)) is n minus some natural number less than or equal to n −1, which is a natural number less than or equal to n. 73. From Exercise 72, a(n) = ⌊(n + 1)μ⌋and a(n −1) = ⌊nμ⌋. Be- cause μ< 1, these two values are equal or they differ by 1. First suppose that μn −⌊μn⌋< 1 −μ. This is equivalent to μ(n+1) < 1+⌊μn⌋. If this is true, then ⌊μ(n+1)⌋= ⌊μn⌋. On the other hand, if μn−⌊μn⌋≥1−μ, then μ(n+1) ≥1+⌊μn⌋, so ⌊μ(n+1)⌋= ⌊μn⌋+1, as desired. 75. f(0) = 1, m(0) = 0; f(1) = 1, m(1) = 0; f(2) = 2, m(2) = 1; f(3) = 2, m(3) = 2; f(4) = 3, m(4) = 2; f(5) = 3, m(5) = 3; f(6) = 4, m(6) = 4; f(7) = 5, m(7) = 4; f(8) = 5, m(8) = 5; f(9) = 6, m(9) = 6 77.

We can now estimate the computational complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm (in terms of additions and comparisons). The algorithm uses no more than n −1 iterations where n is the number of vertices in the graph, because one vertex is added to the distinguished set at each iteration. We are done if we can estimate the number of operations used for each iteration. We can identify the vertex not in Sk with the smallest label using no more than n −1 comparisons. Then we use an addition and a comparison to update the label of each vertex not in Sk. It follows that no more than 2(n −1) operations are used at each iteration, because there are no more than n −1 labels to update at each iteration. Because we use no more than n −1 iterations, each using no more than 2(n −1) operations, we have Theorem 2.",1.0,-1.1505413

Integrals that Result in Inverse Sine Functions Let us begin this last section of the chapter with the three formulas. Along with these formulas, we use substitution to evaluate the integrals. We prove the formula for the inverse sine integral. Rule: Integration Formulas Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions The following integration formulas yield inverse trigonometric functions: 1. (1.23) ⌠ ⌡ du a2 −u2 = sin−1 u a + C 2. (1.24) ⌠ ⌡ du a2 + u2 = 1 atan−1 u a + C 3. (1.25) ⌠ ⌡ du u u2 −a2 = 1 asec−1 u a + C Proof Let y = sin−1 x a. Then asiny = x. Now let’s use implicit differentiation. We obtain d dx ⎛ ⎝asiny ⎞ ⎠= d dx (x) acosy dy dx = 1 dy dx = 1 acosy. For −π 2 ≤y ≤π 2, cosy ≥0. Thus, applying the Pythagorean identity sin2 y + cos2 y = 1, we have cosy = 1 = sin2 y.

What is the formula for this rule?,"589 19.2 Ideal Gas Law Work Done by an Ideal Gas at Constant Temperature Suppose we have an ideal gas at a constant temperature in a closed container whose volume can be changed, such as a cylinder with a piston. This setup allows us to perform an isother- mal process, described in Chapter 18. For an isothermal process, the Ideal Gas Law says that the pressure is equal to a constant times the inverse of the volume: p = nRT/V. If the volume of the container is changed from an initial volume, Vi, to a final volume, Vf, the work done by the gas (see Chapter 18) is given by W pdV V V = i f ∫ . Substituting the expression for the pressure into this integral gives W pdV nRT dV V nRT V V V V V V V = = = i f i f i f ∫ ∫ ( )       ln , which evaluates to W nRT V V = f i ln .             (19.10) Equation 19.10 indicates that the work done by the gas is positive if Vf > Vi and is negative if Vf < Vi.

State the 5.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM AND INTERPRETATIONS.,"758 Chapter 13 A FUNDAMENTAL TOOL: VECTORS Solution (a) Figure 13.22 shows the earth orbiting the sun. Note that the gravitational force vector always points toward the sun and is larger when the earth is closer to the sun because of the 푟2 term in the denominator. (In fact, the real orbit looks much more like a circle than we have shown here.) (b) The velocity vector points in the direction of motion of the earth. Thus, the velocity vector is tangent to the ellipse. See Figure 13.23. Furthermore, the velocity vector is longer at points of the orbit where the planet is moving quickly, because the magnitude of the velocity vector is the speed. Kepler’s Second Law enables us to determine when the earth is moving quickly and when it is moving slowly. Over a fixed period of time, say one month, the line joining the earth to the sun sweeps out a sector having a certain area. Figure 13.23 shows two sectors swept out in two different one-month time-intervals. Kepler’s law says that the areas of the two sectors are the same. Thus, the earth must move farther in a month when it is close to the sun than when it is far from the sun. Therefore, the earth moves faster when it is closer to the sun and slower when it is farther away.

Branch-and-Bound on the ATSP Therefore, there must exist a constant A E (I, e) such that A q{n, s, t) = - + o{l/n), n-t which is (6.2). 0 (6.19) Since Lemma 6.1.4 is important to OUT analysis, we verified its correctness by experimentally solving 10,000 randomly generated assignment problems for each n E {1O, 20, 30,· .. , 100}. OUT results are presented in Figure 6.1. FigUTe 6.1{a) shows that the experiments support (6.1) when s = n/2 excluded arcs and t = 0 included arcs are used. FigUTe 6.1{b) shows that the experiments support (6.2) when s = n/5 excluded arcs and t = n/2 included arcs are employed. A subproblem Xi, which is selected by branch-and-bound subtour elim- ination and generates an optimal tOUT, must be a minimum-cost leaf node in the search tree. Thus the probability of Xi generating an optimal tour cannot be greater than the probability of Xi being a leaf node. Note that Xi can generate a complete tOUT and become a leaf node only when all its ancestors in the search tree do not generate complete tours but Xi does. Lemma 6.1.5. Suppose that two nodes chosen by branch-and-bound sub- tour elimination are independent of each other. Let p be the probability that a nonroot node in the search tree is a leaf, and in particular let Po be the probability that the root is a leaf. For a nonroot node with t included arcs, there exists a constant D, 0 < D < 1 - ~, such that, if t < Dn, then p < Po, where n is the number of cities. Proof. Consider a node Y of a search tree that is generated by equa- tion (1.2). Let the number of included arcs of Y be t and the number of excluded arcs of Y be s, which is also the depth of the node in the search tree. Denote the nodes on the path from the root to the node Y as Yo, Yl , Y2,""', Ys-l, Y, where Yo is the root. From equation (1.2), Yi has i excluded arcs. In addition, let Yi have ti included arcs. By equation (1.2), we have o = to ::; tl ::; t2 ::; ... ::; ts-l ::; t. It is only when none of Yo, YI,""', Ys - l is a leaf node that Y exists in the tree. Therefore, the probability q{n, s, t) of Y's assignment problem solution yielding a complete toUT is equal to the probability that all its ancestors do not generate complete toUTS and Y produces a complete tour.

What is the formula for S-22?,"x > max(k1, k′ 2), and multiplying the second and rewritten third inequali- ties gives |f1(x)∕f2(x)| ≤(C′ 1∕C2)|g1(x)∕g2(x)| for all x > max(k′ 1, k2). It follows that f1∕f2 is big-Theta of g1∕g2. 51. There exist positive constants C1, C2, k1, k2, k′ 1, k′ 2 such that |f(x, y)| ≤C1|g(x, y)| for all x > k1 and y > k2 and |f(x, y)| ≥C2|g(x, y)| for all x > k′ 1 and y > k′ 2. 53. (x2 + xy + x log y)3 < (3x2y3) = 27x6y3 for x > 1 and y > 1, because x2 < x2y, xy < x2y, and x log y < x2y. Hence, (x2 + xy + x log y)3 is O(x6y3). 55. For all positive real numbers x and y, ⌊xy⌋≤xy. Hence, ⌊xy⌋is O(xy) from the definition, taking C = 1 and k1 = k2 = 0. 57. Clearly nd < nc for all n ≥2; therefore, nd is O(nc). The ratio nd∕nc = nd−c is unbounded so there is no constant C such that nd ≤Cnc for large n. 59. If f and g are positivevalued functions such that limn→∞f(x)∕g(x) = C < ∞, then f(x) < (C + 1)g(x) for large enough x, so f(n) is O(g(n)). If that limit is ∞, then f(n) is not O(g(n)). Here repeated ap- plications of L’Hˆ opital’s rule shows that limx→∞xd∕bx = 0 and limx→∞bx∕xd = ∞. 61. To show that cn is O(n!), assume WLOG that c is an integer greater than 1. Claim that if n ≥c2+c, then n! ≥cn. Both n! and cn have n factors. Replac- ing each of the factors from c2 + 1 to c2 + c in n! by c2 only makes the product smaller. But then each of these factors c2 can be factored as c ⋅c and one of those factors of c moved to pair with the factors 1 through c in n!. At this point every fac- tor of n! is greater than or equal to c, so the product is greater than or equal to cn. To show that n! is not O(cn), look at the ra- tio n!∕cn and write this as (c!∕cc)⋅((c+1)∕c)⋅((c+2)∕c)⋅((c+ 3)∕c) ⋯((2c)∕c)⋅((2c+1)∕c) ⋯(n∕c). Treat the product of the",1.0,0.5087646
What is the formula for this rule?,"1088 Chapter 35 Relativity We have restricted all motion to the positive and negative x-directions, just as was done to arrive at the formula for the Lorentz transformation. However, u, u', and v are all vectors and can have positive and negative values, depending on the particular situation to which these transformation equations are applied. In addition, these formulas can also be used to add and subtract two velocities appropriately. Derivation 35.5 Velocity Transformation To see how a velocity transforms from one frame to another, we can start with the Lorentz transformation, which tells us how spatial and time coordinates transform. Then we can take the time derivative of the x-coordinate, which gives us the velocity component in the direction of the relative motion of the two frames with respect to each other (we call this velocity u, be- cause we have already used the symbol v for the velocity of the frames relative to each other):   u dx dt dx vdt dt vdx c ' = ' ' = ( – ) ( – / ). x 2 All we have done up to this point is to express the differentials dx' and dt' in the frame F, with the aid of the Lorentz transformation of equations 35.15. Now we cancel out the factor  in the numerator and denominator and find u dx vdt dt vdx c dx dt v v c dx dt ' = – – / = – 1– . x 2 2 Substituting from ux = dx/dt, we then get the velocity transformation for the longitudinal compo- nent (the component along the direction of the relative motion between the two frames): u u v vu c ' = – 1– . x x x 2 Now we can conduct a similar exercise for the transverse components, that is, the components of the velocity vector perpendicular to the direction of relative motion between the two frames. We show this explicitly for the y-direction, but the z-direction is found using the same argu- ments. Again we take the derivative and Lorentz-transform the differentials, recognizing that dy' = dy:  u dy dt dy dt vdx c ' = ' ' = ( – / ). y 2 Dividing the numerator and denominator by dt then leads to the desired result:             u dy dt v c dx dt u vu c ' = 1– = / 1– . y y x 2 2 Self-Test Opportunity 35.4 Start with ux = dx/dt, use the inverse Lorentz transformation, and show that you arrive at + + u u v vu c x x x = ' 1 ' . 2 Note that in the limit when the speeds are small compared to the speed of light, |v|  c and |u|  c, the term vux/c2 in the denominator of the velocity transformation equation becomes small compared to 1, and  approaches 1, so equations 35.17 and 35.18 approach the non- relativistic limit of u' x = ux – v and ux = u' x + v, u' y = uy, and u' z = uz.

What is the formula for 11.10 SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS: OSCILLATIONS?,"1280 Chapter 40 Nuclear Physics The success of the Bethe-Weizsäcker formula (equation 40.37) for the binding energy is conventionally interpreted as strong support for the liquid-drop model of the nucleus. However, it is really only a consequence of the approximately spherical shape of nuclei, combined with the fact that the strong interaction is short-range and of the order of the nearest-neighbor spacing of the nucleons inside a nucleus. Fermi Gas Model Judging from the success of the liquid-drop model of the nucleus in reproducing the bind- ing energies of nuclei, one might be tempted to think about nucleons as resting in a fixed and approximately spherical arrangement inside the nucleus. However, the Heisenberg uncertainty relation (see Chapter 36) imposes constraints on quantum particles (waves) confined to such a small volume. Since px · x ≥ 1 2 ħ and since a nucleon inside a nucleus is localized to within a few femtometers, there is a high uncertainty in momentum, on the order of 100 MeV/c. (If you remember the handy rule ħc =197.33 MeV/fm, this is easy to see.) That means that nucleons inside the nucleus cannot be considered to be resting in some fixed configuration, but rather they have fairly high momentum uncertainty and thus momentum. The Fermi gas model of the nucleus (proposed by the Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, 1901–1953) takes this momentum into consideration and assumes that nucleons can move freely inside the nucleus like particles of a gas (Figure 40.26). Chapter 37 showed that a particle with mass m and momentum k confined to a cubic box of width a in three dimensions, but able to move freely inside the box, has a total energy of E m k m k k k ma n n x y z x y = = = ħ ħ ħ 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 + + ( ) + +  nz 2 ( ). (40.39) The Pauli Exclusion Principle allows each quantum state to be occupied by exactly four nucleons (one spin-up and one spin-down proton and one spin-up and one spin-down neutron, for each state). We can use this information to calculate the density of states, dN(E), which will tell us how many quantum states reside in an interval dE around a given energy E, for the Fermi gas model. Figure 40.27 illustrates the possible momentum states that can be occupied by the nucleons in the Fermi gas model. Each possible quantum state occupies a volume of (/a)3. Then the number of states, dN(k), between the absolute value of the momentum k and k + dk is given by the ratio of the volume of the spherical shell with radius k and thickness dk and the volume occupied by each quantum state: dN k k dk a a k dk ( ) ( / ) . = = 1 8 2 3 3 2 2 4 2    (40.40) (The factor 1 8 appears in this equation because we are considering only the octant of the three-dimensional sphere in which all three momentum coordinates are positive.",0.0,-0.21690196

Example4 An object is thrown vertically upward with a speed of 10 m/sec from a height of 2 meters above the ground. Find the highest point it reaches and the time when it hits the ground. Solution We must find the position as a function of time. In this example, the velocity is in m/sec, so we use 푔= 9.8 m/sec2. Measuring distance in meters upward from the ground, we have the differential equation 푑푣 푑푡= −9.8. As before, 푣is a function whose derivative is constant, so 푣= −9.8푡+ 퐶. Since the initial velocity is 10 m/sec upward, we know that 푣= 10 when 푡= 0. Substituting gives 10 = −9.8(0) + 퐶 so 퐶= 10. Thus, 푣= −9.8푡+ 10. To find 푠, we use 푣= 푑푠 푑푡= −9.8푡+ 10 and look for a function that has −9.8푡+ 10 as its derivative. The general solution is 푠= −4.9푡2 + 10푡+ 퐾, where 퐾is any constant. To find 퐾, we use the fact that the object starts at a height of 2 meters above the ground, so 푠= 2 when 푡= 0. Substituting gives 2 = −4.9(0)2 + 10(0) + 퐾, so 퐾= 2, and therefore 푠= −4.9푡2 + 10푡+ 2. The object reaches its highest point when the velocity is 0, so at that time 푣= −9.8푡+ 10 = 0. This occurs when 푡= 10 9.8 ≈1.02 sec. When 푡= 1.02 seconds, 푠= −4.9(1.02)2 + 10(1.02) + 2 ≈7.10 meters. So the maximum height reached is 7.10 meters. The object reaches the ground when 푠= 0: 0 = −4.9푡2 + 10푡+ 2. Solving this using the quadratic formula gives 푡≈−0.18 and 푡≈2.22 sec. Since the time at which the object hits the ground must be positive, 푡≈2.22 seconds.",1.0,4.191498

The strongest result proved concerning twin primes is that Links there are infinitely many pairs p and p + 2, where p is prime and p + 2 is prime or the product of two primes (proved by J. R. Chen in 1966). The world’s record for twin primes, as of early 2018, consists of the numbers 2,996,863,034,895 ⋅21,290,000 ± 1, which have 388,342 decimal digits. Let P(n) be the statement that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by exactly n. The twin prime conjecture is the statement that P(2) is true. Mathematicians working on the twin prime conjecture formulated a weaker conjecture, known as the bounded gap conjecture, which asserts that there is an integer N for which P(N) is true. The mathematical community was surprised when Yitang Zhang, a 50-year-old professor at the University of New Hampshire, who had not published a paper since 2001, proved the bounded gap conjecture in 2013. In particular, he showed that there is an integer N < 70,000,000 such that P(N) is true. A team of mathematicians, including Terrance Tao, lowered the Zhang’s bound by showing that there is an integer N ≤246 for which P(N) is true. Furthermore, they showed that if a certain conjecture was true, it could be shown that N ≤6 and that this is the best possible estimate that could be proved using the methods introduced by Zhang. ◂ 4.3.6 Greatest Common Divisors and Least Common Multiples The largest integer that divides both of two integers is called the greatest common divisor of these integers. Definition 2 Let a and b be integers, not both zero. The largest integer d such that d ∣a and d ∣b is called the greatest common divisor of a and b. The greatest common divisor of a and b is denoted by gcd(a, b). The greatest common divisor of two integers, not both zero, exists because the set of com- mon divisors of these integers is nonempty and finite. One way to find the greatest common divisor of two integers is to find all the positive common divisors of both integers and then take the largest divisor. This is done in Examples 10 and 11. Later, a more efficient method of finding greatest common divisors will be given.",1.0,-0.19875643

It was what you achieved that counted — a view that chimes with the Greek stress on the importance of competitive success, where winning was the only thing that mattered. One of the consequences of this was that Greeks tended to take an uncomplicated view of human responsibility. Results counted rather than intentions, and they were not always willing to consider a man’s circumstances to be an exten- uating factor. If one had argued in a Greek court, for example, that an indi- vidual should be excused for killing his parents on the ground that he had had a disturbed upbringing, a Greek might well have seen that not as anexcuse _ for acquitting him, but as an added reason for condemning him.

But the Peiraieus, with its large natural harbours, was ideally placed and equipped to become the trading centre for the Aegean, and during the fifth century it became the hub of the commerce of the entire eastern Mediterranean world (cf. 1.32). By the middle of the fifth century, Peiraicus had been laid out as a new town on a grid plan by Hippodamos of Milétos, linked to Athens by the Long Walls, and provided with both commercial and naval harbours and dock facilities. In the fourth century, several important boards of officials, in charge of civic order (astunomoi), the market (agordnomoi), weights and measures (metronomoi) and grain supply (sitephulakes), were shared equally between Athens and the Peiraieus ({Aristotle], Constitution of the Athenians 50-1).

What is the formula for this rule?,"176 C H A P T E R 6 Firms, the Stock Market, and Corporate Governance promised coupon or principal payments. The higher the default risk on a bond, the higher the interest rate. For example, investors see the federal government as being very unlikely to default on its bonds, so federal government bonds pay a lower interest rate than do bonds of a firm such as GE. In turn, GE pays a lower interest rate on its bonds than does a corporation that investors believe is not as likely to make its bond payments. The Rating Game: Is the U.S. Treasury Likely to Default on Its Bonds? Federal regulations require that before they can sell bonds to investors, firms and governments must first have bonds rated by one of the credit rating agencies. The three largest rating agencies are Moody’s Inves- tors Service, Standard & Poor’s Corporation, and Fitch Ratings. These private firms rate bonds by giving them letter grades—AAA or Aaa being the highest—that reflect the probability that the firm or government will be able to make the payments on the bond. The following table shows the ratings: Making the Connection Moody’s Investors Service Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Fitch Ratings Meaning of the Ratings Investment-grade bonds Aaa Aa A Baa AAA AA A BBB AAA AA A BBB Highest credit quality Very high credit quality High credit quality Good credit quality Non-investment- grade bonds Ba B Caa Ca C — BB B CCC CC C D BB B CCC CC C D Speculative Highly speculative Substantial default risk Very high levels of default risk Exceptionally high levels of default risk Default Note: The entries in the “Meaning of the Ratings” column are slightly modified from those that Fitch uses. The other two rating agencies have similar descriptions. For each rating from Aa to Caa, Moody’s adds a numerical modifier of 1, 2, or 3. The rating Aa1 is higher than the rating Aa2, and the rating Aa2 is higher than the rating Aa3. Similarly, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings add a plus (+) or minus (−) sign. The rating AA+ is higher than the rating AA, and the rating AA is higher than the rating AA−. Source: Money, Banking, and the Financial System 1st edition by R. Glenn Hubbard and Anthony P. O’Brien.

Investors can use the ratings in deciding how much risk they are willing to take on when buying a bond. Generally, the lower the rating, the higher the interest rate an investor will receive, but also the higher the risk that the issuer of the bond will default. The ratings agencies charge firms and governments—rather than investors—for their services. This arrangement raises the question of whether rating agencies face a conflict of interest. Because firms issuing bonds can choose which of the agencies to hire to rate their bonds, the agencies may have an incentive to give higher ratings than might be justified in order to keep the firms’ business. During the housing boom of the mid-2000s, some financial firms issued mortgage-backed bonds. These bonds were simi- lar to regular corporate bonds except that the interest payments came from mortgage loans people had taken out to buy houses. The money from those mortgage payments was passed along to investors who had bought the mortgage-backed bonds. The rat- ing agencies gave many of these bonds AAA ratings, even though when housing prices began to decline in 2006, the issuers of many of these bonds defaulted on them.",0.0,-3.9904413
What is the formula for this rule?,"12.6 • The Solid State: Structure, Properties, and Bonding 373 This change in density is vital for freshwater life. When the surface of a lake freezes in winter, the ice floats. If the solid were denser than the liquid, as is true for nearly every other substance, the surface water would freeze and sink until the entire lake was solid. Aquatic life would not survive from year to year. As lake water becomes colder in the fall and early winter, it becomes more dense before it freezes. Similarly, in spring, less dense ice thaws to form more dense water before the water expands. During both of these seasonal density changes, the top layer of water reaches the high-density point first and sinks. The next layer of water rises because it is slightly less dense, reaches 4°C, and likewise sinks. This sinking and rising distribute nutrients and dissolved oxygen. Summary of Section 12.5 • The atomic properties of H and O result in water’s bent molecular shape, polarity, and H-bonding ability. • These properties give water the ability to dissolve many ionic and polar compounds. • Water’s high specific heat capacity and heat of vaporization give Earth and its organisms a narrow temperature range. • Water’s exceptionally high surface tension and capillarity are essential to plants and animals. • Because water expands on freezing, lake life survives in winter and nutrients mix from seasonal density changes. 12.6 •   The Solid State: Structure, Properties, and Bonding Stroll through a museum’s mineral collection, and you’ll be struck by the variety and beauty of crystalline solids. In this section, we discuss the structural features of these and other solids and the intermolecular forces that create them. We also consider the main bonding model that explains many properties of solids. Structural Features of Solids We can divide solids into two broad categories: • Crystalline solids have well defined shapes because their particles—atoms, molecules, or ions—occur in an orderly arrangement (Figure 12.21). • Amorphous solids have poorly defined shapes because their particles lack an orderly arrangement throughout the sample.

This problem is about using cost curve graphs to analyze perfectly competitive firms, so you may want to review the section “Illustrating Profit or Loss on the Cost Curve Graph” on page 403. Step 2: Calculate Andy’s marginal cost, average total cost, and average variable cost. To maximize profit, Andy will produce the level of output where mar- ginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. We can calculate marginal cost from the information given in the table. We can also calculate average total cost and average variable cost in order to draw the required graph. Average total cost (ATC) equals total cost (TC) divided by the level of output (Q). Average variable cost (AVC) equals variable cost (VC) divided by output (Q). To calculate vari- able cost, recall that total cost equals variable cost plus fixed cost. When output equals zero, total cost equals fixed cost. In this case, fixed cost equals $10.00.

What is the formula for this rule?,".4). In Chapter 22, we saw that an electric dipole consists of a positive charge and a negative charge, which have equal magnitudes, meaning that the dipole has zero net charge. Since, according to equation 23.4, the work done in moving an object through a constant electric field is proportional to the charge on that object, the net work done in moving an electric dipole through a constant electric field is zero. This fact may make it seem impossible to store potential energy in a system consisting of a dipole in a constant field. However, this is not the case. In Chapter 22, we saw that a dipole in a constant electric field experiences a torque, p E = ,  × and so it is clear that the orientation of the dipole relative to the electric field is key. Let’s see how the orientation of the dipole can result in the storage of potential energy. In Chapter 10, we saw that the work done by a torque is given by W d = ( ') '. ∫ If we apply an external torque opposing the torque that the dipole experiences from the electric field, we can express the work done by this external torque as follows: W d pE d pE d pE = ( ') ' = – sin ' ' =– sin ' ' = (cos –cos ). 0 0 0 0 ∫ ∫ ∫ Figure 23.2 ​ Work done by an electric field, , E on a moving charge, q: (a) case where the displacement is in the same direction as the electric field, (b) general case, (c) case where the displacement is opposite to the direction of the electric field.

The average age of death in England is about 80 for men and 83 for women. The average age of death from alleged ‘Covid’ is between 82 and 83. California doctors, Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi, said at their April media conference that projection models of millions of deaths had been ‘woefully inaccurate’. They produced detailed figures showing that Californians had a 0.03 chance of dying from ‘Covid’ based on the number of people who tested positive (with a test not testing for the ‘virus’). Erickson said there was a 0.1 percent chance of dying from ‘Covid’ in the state of New York, not just the city, and a 0.05 percent chance in Spain, a centre of ‘Covid-19’ hysteria at one stage. The Stanford studies supported the doctors’ data with fatality rate estimates of 0.23 and 0.15 percent. How close are these figures to my estimate of zero? Death-rate figures claimed by the World Health Organization at the start of the hoax were some 15 times higher. The California doctors said there was no justification for lockdowns and the economic devastation they caused. Everything they had ever learned about quarantine was that you quarantine the sick and not the healthy. They had never seen this before and it made no medical sense. Why in the in the light of all this would governments and medical systems the world over say that billions must go under house arrest; lose their livelihood; in many cases lose their mind, their health and their life; force people to wear masks dangerous to health and psychology; make human interaction and even family interaction a criminal offence; ban travel; close restaurants, bars, watching live sport, concerts, theatre, and any activity involving human togetherness and discourse; and closing schools to isolate children from their friends and cause many to commit suicide in acts of hopelessness and despair? The California doctors said lockdown consequences included increased child abuse, partner abuse, alcoholism, depression, and other impacts they were seeing every day.

What is the formula for IFRS AND GAAP?,"In this supplement, we review and contrast IFRS and GAAP as they relate to topics raised in earlier chapters of the text. We begin with a theoretical discussion of similarities and differ ences between IFRS and GAAP that potentially affect the accounting rules for specific topics. We then follow with a summary of specific topic discussions. Overview Generally speaking, IFRS and GAAP are similar. Both aim to guide businesses in reporting financial information that is relevant and that faithfully represents the underlying activities of businesses. At a basic level, these accounting rules describe (1) when an item should be recognized in the accounting system, (2) how that item should be classified (e.g., asset or expense, revenue or liability), and (3) the amount at which each item should be measured. Many differences between IFRS and GAAP that we have noted in this book relate to cases where IFRS requires or allows companies to report items using values that differ from those required or allowed by GAAP. For example, in Chapter 9, we noted that IFRS allows companies to report fixed assets at fair values. Researchers studying a sample of European and Canadian companies found that financial ratios changed significantly when the compa nies switched from GAAP to IFRS.2 Thus, it is useful for you to consider the effects of pos sible accounting differences when doing your own analyses. A summary of the differences introduced in this text is presented in the next section. 2See Anna-Maija Lantto and Petri Sahlström, “Impact of International Financial Reporting Standard Adop- tion on Key Financial Ratios,” Accounting and Finance 49 (2009), pp. 341–361; and Michel Blanchette, François-Eric Raciot, and Jean-Yves Girard, The Effects of IFRS on Financial Ratios: Early Evidence in Canada (CGA-Canada, 2011).

What is the formula for 3.10 Bibliographical and Historical Remarks?,"63 The quantification ∀x∃yQ(x, y) denotes the proposition “For every real number x there is a real number y such that Q(x, y).” Given a real number x, there is a real number y such that x + y = 0; namely, y = −x. Hence, the statement ∀x∃yQ(x, y) is true. Be careful with the order of existential and universal quantifiers! ◂ Example 4 illustrates that the order in which quantifiers appear makes a difference. The statements ∃y∀xP(x, y) and ∀x∃yP(x, y) are not logically equivalent. The statement ∃y∀xP(x, y) is true if and only if there is a y that makes P(x, y) true for every x. So, for this statement to be true, there must be a particular value of y for which P(x, y) is true regardless of the choice of x. On the other hand, ∀x∃yP(x, y) is true if and only if for every value of x there is a value of y for which P(x, y) is true. So, for this statement to be true, no matter which x you choose, there must be a value of y (possibly depending on the x you choose) for which P(x, y) is true. In other words, in the second case, y can depend on x, whereas in the first case, y is a constant independent of x. From these observations, it follows that if ∃y∀xP(x, y) is true, then ∀x∃yP(x, y) must also be true. However, if ∀x∃yP(x, y) is true, it is not necessary for ∃y∀xP(x, y) to be true.

The levels of sickness after vaccination is unprecedented and staff are getting very sick and some with neurological symptoms which is having a huge impact on the health service function. Even the young and healthy are off for days, some for weeks, and some requiring medical treatment. Whole teams are being taken out as they went to get vaccinated together. Mandatory vaccination in this instance is stupid, unethical and irresponsible when it comes to protecting our staff and public health. We are in the voluntary phase of vaccination, and encouraging staff to take an unlicensed product that is impacting on their immediate health ... it is clearly stated that these vaccine products do not offer immunity or stop transmission.

What is the formula for this rule?,"Appendix Using Graphs and Formulas Graphs are used to illustrate key economic ideas. Graphs appear not just in economics textbooks but also on Web sites and in newspaper and magazine articles that discuss events in business and economics. Why the heavy use of graphs? Because they serve two useful purposes: (1) They simplify economic ideas, and (2) they make the ideas more concrete so they can be applied to real-world problems. Economic and business issues can be complicated, but a graph can help cut through complications and highlight the key relationships needed to understand the issue. In that sense, a graph can be like a street map. For example, suppose you take a bus to New York City to see the Empire State Building. After arriving at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, you will probably use a map similar to the one shown below to find your way to the Empire State Building. Maps are very familiar to just about everyone, so we don’t usually think of them as being simplified versions of reality, but they are. This map does not show much more than the streets in this part of New York City and some of the most important build- ings. The names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the people who live and work in the area aren’t given. Almost none of the stores and buildings those people work and live in are shown either. The map doesn’t indicate which streets allow curbside parking and which don’t. In fact, the map shows almost nothing about the messy real- ity of life in this section of New York City, except how the streets are laid out, which is the essential information you need to get from the Port Authority to the Empire State Building.",0.0,0.33964813

The trouble of ordering and tracking each product line had exceeded the profits earned. In December, a supplier asked her to sell a prepackaged spa kit. Feeling she could manage a single product line, Nicole agreed. Nicole’s Getaway Spa (NGS) would make monthly purchases from the supplier at a cost that included production costs and a transportation charge. NGS would keep track of its new inventory using a perpetual inventory system. On December 31 of last year, NGS had 10 units at a total cost of $6 per unit. Nicole purchased 25 more units at $8 in February. In March, Nicole purchased 15 units at $10 per unit. In May, 50 units were purchased at $9.80 per unit. In June, NGS sold 50 units at a selling price of $12 per unit and 35 units at $10 per unit. Required: 1. Explain whether the transportation cost included in each purchase should be recorded as a cost of the inventory or immediately expensed. 2. Compute the Cost of Goods Available for Sale, Cost of Goods Sold, and Cost of Ending Inventory using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. 3. Calculate the inventory turnover ratio (round to one decimal place), using the inventory purchased on December 31 as the beginning inventory. The supplier reported that the typical inventory turnover ratio was 6.0. How does NGS’s ratio compare? 4. Would a different inventory cost flow assumption allow Nicole’s Getaway Spa to better minimize its income tax? ® LO 7-3, 7-5 To minimize income taxes, inventory is valued at cost using the LIFO inventory method.

Other quantities are characteristic of the particular system: mass, m; spring constant, k; pendulum length, ; period, T; frequency, f; and angular frequency, . It is helpful to list the quantities you are looking for in a problem and the quantities you know or need to deter- mine to find those unknowns. 2. ​ All harmonic oscillations are produced by forces that de- pend linearly on the deflection from the equilibrium posi- tion and that always point toward the equilibrium position. Any time the given situation includes such a force, harmonic motion will result. 3. ​ For harmonic oscillations, the kinetic energy is at a maxi- mum when the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium position, and the potential energy is at a maximum (and the kinetic energy is zero) at the maximum displacement from equilibrium. 4. For problems involving damping, it is essential to first determine whether the system is weakly damped, critically damped, or overdamped, because the form of the equation of motion you should use depends on the type of damping. bau13881_ch14.indd 456 8/7/12 12:39 PM",0.0,-4.887291

Project Wuhan – the ‘Covid’ Psyop I emphasise again that the Cult plays the long game and what is happening to the world today is the result of centuries of calculated manipulation following a script to take control step-by-step of every aspect of human society. I will discuss later the common force behind all this that has spanned those centuries and thousands of years if the truth be told. Instigating the Mao revolution in China in 1949 with a 2020 ‘pandemic’ in mind is not only how they work – the 71 years between them is really quite short by the Cult’s standards of manipulation preparation. The reason for the Cult’s Chinese revolution was to create a fiercely-controlled environment within which an extreme structure for human control could be incubated to eventually be unleashed across the world. We have seen this happen since the ‘pandemic’ emerged from China with the Chinese control- structure founded on AI technology and tyrannical enforcement sweep across the West. Until the moment when the Cult went for broke in the West and put its fascism on public display Western governments had to pay some lip-service to freedom and democracy to not alert too many people to the tyranny-in-the-making. Freedoms were more subtly eroded and power centralised with covert government structures put in place waiting for the arrival of 2020 when that smokescreen of ‘freedom’ could be dispensed with. The West was not able to move towards tyranny before 2020 anything like as fast as China which was created as a tyranny and had no limits on how fast it could construct the Cult’s blueprint for global control. When the time came to impose that structure on the world it was the same Cult-owned Chinese communist/fascist government that provided the excuse – the ‘Covid pandemic’.

What is the formula for this rule?,"So far, we have established that photons are the quantum particles of light and of all other electromagnetic radiation. However, everything we have said about the wave nature of light is still true; for example, we can demonstrate interference and diffraction, which are typical wave phenomena. Looking at light as quantum particles does not invalidate the wave pic- ture of light, just as the ray picture of light can be seen as a special limiting case of the more general wave description of light. Given the quantum character of light and the particle character of electromagnetic waves, do things that we ordinarily think of as particles, like electrons and atoms, also have wave properties? This is exactly what Prince Louis de Broglie (1892–1987), a French gradu- ate student at the time, proposed in 1923. His original publication, all of four pages long, contained this hypothesis, and he later was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929. If particles have wave character, then what is the appropriate wavelength? For light, we found (equation 36.17) that the momentum of a photon is p = h/. De Broglie used the same relationship for particles and proposed as the relevant wavelength for matter waves: h p h mv h mv v c = = = 1– . 2 2 (36.22) This wavelength, the de Broglie wavelength, depends on the mass m and speed v of a par- ticle. Equation 36.22 used the relativistic form of the momentum, p = mv, but the literature often presents this nonrelativistic approximation for the de Broglie wavelength: h mv = (nonrelativistic approximation).  (36.23) As Figure 36.12 shows for the case of an electron, at speeds of up to 40% of the speed of light, the nonrelativistic approximation is very close to the exact result given by equation 36.22. As you can see from Figure 36.12, the de Broglie wavelength of an electron, even one moving at 10% of the speed of light, is on the order of one-tenth of a nanometer. What are typical de Broglie wavelengths for macroscopic objects? Example 36.3 shows a calculation. and p c c ' =(133.08 keV/ )sin(32.300°)= 71.112 keV/ . y Thus, the components of the electron’s momentum are p p p c c c = – ' =138.67 keV/ –112.49 keV/ = 26.18 keV/ x x x e, and p p p c = – ' = –71.11 keV/ . y y y e, Now we can obtain the magnitude of the electron’s momentum vector by the usual procedure of taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the components: + p p p c = = 75.8 keV/ . x y e e, 2 e, 2 This is the same result as we obtained above, showing that our two methods of solution are consistent with each other. ​ Self-Test Opportunity 36.4 Why do you have to use X-rays to observe the Compton effect?

What is the formula for this rule?,"Interval Test Point Sign of Derivative f′(x) = 3x2 −3 = 3(x −1)(x + 1) Conclusion (−∞, −1) x = −2 (+)(−)(−) = + f is increasing. (−1, 1) x = 0 (+)(−)(+) = − f is decreasing. (1, ∞) x = 2 (+)(+)(+) = + f is increasing. From the table, we see that f has a local maximum at x = −1 and a local minimum at x = 1. Evaluating f(x) at those two points, we find that the local maximum value is f(−1) = 4 and the local minimum value is f(1) = 0. Step 6: The second derivative of f is f′′(x) = 6x. The second derivative is zero at x = 0. Therefore, to determine the concavity of f, divide the interval (−∞, ∞) into the smaller intervals (−∞, 0) and (0, ∞), and choose test points x = −1 and x = 1 to determine the concavity of f on each of these smaller intervals as shown in the following table. Interval Test Point Sign of f′′(x) = 6x Conclusion (−∞, 0) x = −1 − f is concave down. (0, ∞) x = 1 + f is concave up. We note that the information in the preceding table confirms the fact, found in step 5, that f has a local maximum at x = −1 and a local minimum at x = 1. In addition, the information found in step 5 —namely, f has a local maximum at x = −1 and a local minimum at x = 1, and f′(x) = 0 at those points—combined with the fact that f′′ changes sign only at x = 0 confirms the results found in step 6 on the concavity of f. Combining this information, we arrive at the graph of f(x) = (x −1)2 (x + 2) shown in the following graph. 432 Chapter 4 | Applications of Derivatives This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11964/1.2",0.0,0.9232377

Perhaps more amazing, it has developed special organs (called the ampullae of Lorenzini) that can detect the tiny electric fi elds generated by the movement of muscles in an organism, whether a fi sh, a seal, or a human. However, just what are electric fi elds? In addition, how are they related to electric charges? Th e concept of vector fi elds is one of the most useful and productive ideas in all of physics. Th is chapter explains what an electric fi eld is and how it is con- nected to electrostatic charges and forces and then examines how to determine the electric fi eld due to some given distribution of charge. Th is study leads us to one of the most important laws of electricity—Gauss’s Law—which provides a relationship between electric fi elds and electrostatic charge. However, Gauss’s Law has practical application only when the charge distribution has enough geometric symmetry to simplify the calculation, and even then, some other concepts related to electric fi elds are necessary in order to apply the equations. We’ll examine another kind of fi eld—magnetic fi elds—in Chapters 27 through 29.

Generating functions can be used to solve many types of counting problems, such as the number of ways to select or distribute objects of different kinds, subject to a variety of constraints, and the number of ways to make change for a dollar using coins of different denominations. Generating functions can be used to solve recurrence relations by translating a recurrence relation for the terms of a sequence into an equation involving a generating function. This equation can then be solved to find a closed form for the generating function. From this closed form, the coefficients of the power series for the generating function can be found, solving the original recurrence relation. Generating functions can also be used to prove combinatorial identities by taking advantage of relatively simple relationships between functions that can be translated into identities involving the terms of sequences. Generating functions are a helpful tool for studying many properties of sequences besides those described in this section, such as their use for establishing asymptotic formulae for the terms of a sequence. We begin with the definition of the generating function for a sequence. Definition 1 The generating function for the sequence a0, a1, ... , ak, ... of real numbers is the infinite series G(x) = a0 + a1x + ⋯+ akxk + ⋯= ∞ ∑ k = 0 akxk.",1.0,6.6549215
What is the formula for this rule?,"Given an algebraic formula for a function f, the graph of f is the set of points ⎛ ⎝x, f(x) ⎞ ⎠, where x is in the domain of f and f(x) is in the range. To graph a function given by a formula, it is helpful to begin by using the formula to create a table of inputs and outputs. If the domain of f consists of an infinite number of values, we cannot list all of them, but because listing some of the inputs and outputs can be very useful, it is often a good way to begin. When creating a table of inputs and outputs, we typically check to determine whether zero is an output. Those values of x where f(x) = 0 are called the zeros of a function. For example, the zeros of f(x) = x2 −4 are x = ± 2. The zeros determine where the graph of f intersects the x -axis, which gives us more information about the shape of the graph of the function. The graph of a function may never intersect the x-axis, or it may intersect multiple (or even infinitely many) times. Another point of interest is the y -intercept, if it exists. The y -intercept is given by ⎛ ⎝0, f(0) ⎞ ⎠. Since a function has exactly one output for each input, the graph of a function can have, at most, one y -intercept. If x = 0 is in the domain of a function f, then f has exactly one y -intercept. If x = 0 is not in the domain of f, then f has no y -intercept. Similarly, for any real number c, if c is in the domain of f, there is exactly one output f(c), and the line x = c intersects the graph of f exactly once. On the other hand, if c is not in the domain of f, f(c) is not defined and the line x = c does not intersect the graph of f. This property is summarized in the vertical line test. Rule: Vertical Line Test Given a function f, every vertical line that may be drawn intersects the graph of f no more than once. If any vertical line intersects a set of points more than once, the set of points does not represent a function. We can use this test to determine whether a set of plotted points represents the graph of a function (Figure 1.8). Figure 1.8 (a) The set of plotted points represents the graph of a function because every vertical line intersects the set of points, at most, once. (b) The set of plotted points does not represent the graph of a function because some vertical lines intersect the set of points more than once.

What is the formula for 3.28 A particle’s motion is described by the following two parametric?,"46 Chapter 2 Motion in a Straight Line Similarly, the x-component of the instantaneous acceleration is defined as the limit of the average acceleration as the time interval approaches 0: a a v t dv dt x t x t x x = = lim lim .     → → 0 0 ≡  (2.11) We can now define the acceleration vector as a dv dt = ,  (2.12) where again the derivative operation is understood to act component-wise, just as in the definition of the velocity vector. Figure 2.10 illustrates this relationship among velocity, time interval, average accel- eration, and instantaneous acceleration as the limit of the average acceleration (for a decreasing time interval). In Figure 2.10a, the average acceleration is given by the veloc- ity change, v1, divided by the time interval t1: a 1 = v1/t1. In Figure 2.10b, the average acceleration is determined over a smaller time interval, t2. In Figure 2.10c, the instanta- neous acceleration, a(t3) = dv/dt|t = t3, is represented by the slope of the blue line tangent to the red curve at t = t3. Figure 2.10 looks very similar to Figure 2.6, and this is not a coincidence. The similarity emphasizes that the mathematical operations and physical relationships that connect the velocity and acceleration vectors are the same as those that connect the position and velocity vectors. The acceleration is the time derivative of the velocity, and the velocity is the time derivative of the displacement. The acceleration is therefore the second derivative of the displacement: a d dt v d dt d dt x d dt x x x = = =             2 2 . (2.13) There is no word in everyday language for the absolute value of the acceleration. Note that we often refer to the deceleration of an object as a decrease in the speed of the object over time, which corresponds to acceleration in the opposite direction of the motion of the object. In one-dimensional motion, an acceleration, which is a change in velocity, necessarily entails a change in the magnitude of the velocity—that is, the speed. However, in the next chapter, we will consider motion in more than one spatial dimension, where the velocity vector can also change its direction, not just its magnitude. In Chapter 9, we will examine motion in a circle with constant speed; in that case, there is a constant acceleration that keeps the object on a circular path but leaves the speed constant. As Concept Check 2.5 shows, even in one dimension, a positive acceleration does not necessarily mean speeding up and a negative acceleration does not mean that an object must be slowing down. Rather, the combination of velocity and acceleration determines the motion. If the velocity and acceleration are in the same direction, the object moves faster; if they are in opposite directions, it slows down. We will examine this relationship further in the next chapter.

What is the formula for 3.3 THE PRODUCT AND QUOTIENT RULES?,"526 C H A P T E R 1 6 Pricing Strategy Airlines divide their customers into two main categories: business travelers and lei- sure travelers. Business travelers often have inflexible schedules, can’t commit until the last minute to traveling on a particular day, and, most importantly, are not very sensitive to changes in price. The opposite is true for leisure travelers: They are flexible about when they travel, willing to buy their tickets well in advance, and sensitive to changes in price. Based on what we discussed earlier in this chapter, you can see that airlines will maximize profits by charging business travelers higher ticket prices than leisure travelers, but they need to determine who is a business traveler and who is a leisure traveler. Some airlines do this by requiring people who want to buy a ticket at the leisure price to buy 14 days in advance and to stay at their destination over a Saturday night. Anyone un- able to meet these requirements must pay a much higher price. Business travelers end up paying the higher ticket price because they often cannot make their plans 14 days in advance of their flight and don’t want to stay over a weekend. The gap between leisure fares and business fares is often substantial. For example, in September 2011, the price of a leisure-fare ticket between New York and San Francisco on Continental Airlines was $378. The price of a business-fare ticket was $1,008. The airlines go well beyond a single leisure fare and a single business fare in their pricing strategies. Although they ordinarily charge high prices for tickets sold only a few days in advance, airlines are willing to reduce prices for seats that they expect won’t sell at existing prices. Since the late 1980s, airlines have employed economists and math- ematicians to construct computer models of the market for airline tickets. To calculate a suggested price each day for each seat, these models take into account factors that affect the demand for tickets, such as the season of the year, the length of the route, the day of the week, and whether the flight typically attracts primarily business or leisure travelers. This practice of continually adjusting prices to take into account fluctuations in demand is called yield management. Since the late 1990s, Internet sites such as Priceline.com have helped the airlines to implement yield management. On Priceline.com, buyers commit to paying a price of their choosing for a ticket on a particular day and agree that they will fly at any time on that day. This gives airlines the opportunity to fill seats that otherwise would have gone empty, particularly on late-night or early-morning flights, even though the price may be well below the normal leisure fare. In 2001, several airlines came together to form the Internet site Orbitz, which became another means of filling seats at discount prices. In fact, in the past few years, the chance that you paid the same price for your airline ticket as the person sitting next to you has become quite small.

Integrate both sides: ⌠ ⌡ dT T −75 = ∫kdt ln|T −75| = kt + C. 4. Solve for T by first exponentiating both sides: eln|T −75| = ekt + C |T −75| = C1 ekt T −75 = C1 ekt T(t) = 75 + C1 ekt. 5. Solve for C1 by using the initial condition T(0) = 350: T(t) = 75 + C1 ekt T(0) = 75 + C1 ek(0) 350 = 75 + C1 C1 = 275. Therefore the solution to the initial-value problem is T(t) = 75 + 275ekt. To determine the value of k, we need to use the fact that after 5 minutes the temperature of the pizza is 340°F. Therefore T(5) = 340. Substituting this information into the solution to the initial-value problem, we have T(t) = 75 + 275ekt T(5) = 340 = 75 + 275e5k 265 = 275e5k e5k = 53 55 lne5k = ln⎛ ⎝53 55 ⎞ ⎠ 5k = ln⎛ ⎝53 55 ⎞ ⎠ k = 1 5 ln⎛ ⎝53 55 ⎞ ⎠≈−0.007408.

What is the formula for this rule?,"1248 Chapter 39 Elementary Particle Physics The entire universe came into being through a singular event that we call the Big Bang. This event happened (13.75±0.11) · 109 years ago. Although the age of the universe cannot be fixed with an uncertainty smaller than 120 million years, physicists are able to state how the universe developed in the first fractions of a sec- ond after the Big Bang. The Planck time is the earliest time after the Big Bang for which it makes any sense to try to deduce a history of the universe (Figure 39.42). (See Example 39.2.) At a time of 10–43 s, the temperature was on the order of 1032 K. All forces were unified at that time, with gravity separating from the other forces a short time thereafter. The era of grand unification of the strong and electroweak forces is esti- mated to have lasted to about 10–34 s, when the strong force became separated from the electroweak force. At the end of this era, the universe underwent a rapid inflationary expansion. To understand why this process had to have been part of the universe’s history, we need to discuss the cosmological concept of inflation. Inflation Three important questions have puzzled astronomers for a long time: 1. Why is the cosmic microwave background radiation so incredibly isotropic, which is to say, smooth and very much the same in every direction? 2. Why is the universe made entirely of matter and not of antimatter? 3. Why is the universe so incredibly flat (a term to be explained shortly)? All three questions deserve some elaboration to show how truly startling these facts are. First, let’s think about the smoothness of the cosmic microwave background. As we saw in Chapter 36, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation shows a perfect blackbody spectrum at a temperature of 2.725 K. CMB radiation was discovered in 1965 by Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1978. This radiation had been predicted in 1948 by George Gamov, Ralph Alpher, and Robert Herman as a consequence of the Big Bang model, which at that time was still very specula- tive and only one of several possible models of the time evolution of the universe. Only Figure 39.42 ​ Temperature of the universe as a function of time. The red circle with the cross marks the current universe, and the vertical gray lines mark the approximate boundaries between the different eras. For each era, the basic constituents are shown.

Since each of the component functions cos(푘푥) and sin(푘푥), 푘= 1, 2, ..., 푛, repeats every 2휋, 퐹푛(푥) must repeat every 2휋and so is a potentially good match for 푓(푥), which also repeats every 2휋. The problem is to determine values for the Fourier coefficients that achieve a close match between 푓(푥) and 퐹푛(푥).

What is the formula for this rule?,"and the support surface, in this case). This internal excitation energy can take the form of vibrations or thermal energy or even chemical or electrical energy. The main point is that the conversion of kinetic and/or potential energy to internal excitation energy is not reversible; that is, the internal excitation energy cannot be fully converted back into kinetic and/or potential energy. Thus, we see that the friction force is an example of a nonconservative force. Because the friction force always acts in a direction opposite to the displacement, the dissipation of energy due to the friction force always reduces the total mechanical energy, whether or not the path is closed. Work done by a conservative force, W, can be positive or negative, but the dissipation from the friction force, Wf, is always negative, withdrawing kinetic and/or potential energy and converting it into internal excitation energy. Using the symbol Wf for this dissipated energy is a reminder that we use the same procedures to calculate it as to calculate work for conservative forces. The decisive fact is that the friction force switches direction as a function of the direction of motion and causes dissipation. The friction force vector is always antiparallel to the velocity vector; any force with this property cannot be conservative.

What is the formula for 1.6 Rules of Inference?,"79 same intercity-distance range r are not necessarily the same. Furthermore, the number of distinct intercity distances of two problem instances that are generated using two different values of r may be the same. Therefore we rearranged the problem instances generated from all values of r that we used, according to their numbers of distinct intercity distances. Since some numbers of distinct intercity distance may be represented by only a few problem instances, we chose those numbers of distinct intercity dis- tances that are represented by more than 30 problem instances, and plotted in Figure 4.1O(c) the average number of assignment problems solved as a function of the number of distinct intercity distances. Figure 4.10(c) shows that the complexity of the asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem in- creases with the number of distinct intercity distances. For example, when the number of distinct intercity distances is less than 40, the average total number of assignment problems solved is less than 25, and when the num- ber of distinct intercity distances is greater than 100, the total number of assignment problems solved is greater than 120. In short, when intercity distances are chosen from a uniform distribution, the number of distinct intercity distances serves as the order parameter of the complexity transi- tion. The problem is easy to solve when the number of distinct intercity distances is small, but is difficult when this number is large. We now consider the log-normal distribution. Figure 4.11(a) and Fig- ure 4.11(b) show the average tour length and the number of distinct intercity distances, averaged over the same 1,000 problem instances of the 100-city asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problem for each standard devi- ation (J"" as those used for Figure 4.9 in Section 4.3.1, as a function of (J"". Figure 4.11(a) shows that when (J"" < 10, the average tour length is close to 100 x 1,000, indicating that the intercity distances included in the ATSP tour are close to the mean of the distribution, which is 1000. When (J"" ~ 3000 (after point D in Figure 4.11(a)), the average tour length is less than 1000, and approaches zero quickly, indicating that small intercity distances are included in the ATSP tour, although large ones exist. This is due mostly to the fact that in this case most intercity distances are very small, and only a few large ones exist. Figure 4.11(b) shows that the average number of distinct intercity distances increases with (J"" when 0.1 :S (J"" :S 2,000. How- ever, it decreases with (J"" when 2,000 :S (J"" :S 10,000,000 (After point D' in Figure 4.11 (b)). This further indicates that more small intercity distances are generated for (J"" > 2,000 in order to keep the mean constant. Most of these small distances are the same after being discretized. This is also the reason that the complexity drops quickly when (J"" ~ 2,000 in Figure 4.9(f). We further examined the relationship between the number of distinct in- tercity distances and the number of assignment problems solved. As we did in the case of the uniform distribution, we rearranged the problem instances according to their numbers of distinct intercity distances, and report the results for the numbers represented by more than 30 problem instances.",0.0,-2.5545423

Links His father was a retired army officer who had fought against Napoleon. In 1832 the family, with its nine children, moved to Moscow, where Pafnuty completed his high school education at home. He entered the Department of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University. As a student, he developed a new method for approximating the roots of equations. He graduated from Moscow University in 1841 with a degree in mathematics, and he continued his studies, passing his master’s exam in 1843 and completing his master’s thesis in 1846. Chebyshev was appointed in 1847 to a position as an assistant at the University of St. Petersburg. He wrote and defended a thesis in 1847. He became a professor at St. Petersburg in 1860, a position he held until 1882. His book on the theory of congruences written in 1849 was influential in the development of number theory. His work on the distribution of prime numbers was seminal. He proved Bertrand’s conjec- ture that for every integer n > 3, there is a prime between n and 2n −2. Chebyshev helped develop ideas that were later used to prove the prime number theorem. Chebyshev’s work on the approximation of functions using polynomials is used extensively when computers are used to find values of functions. Chebyshev was also interested in mechanics. He studied the conversion of rotary motion into rectilinear motion by mechanical coupling. The Chebyshev parallel motion is three linked bars approximating rectilinear motion.",0.0,0.3061273

What is the formula for A LITTLE PROOF STRATEGY?,"We have described two important approaches for proving theorems of the form ∀x(P(x) →Q(x)): direct proof and proof by contraposition. We have also given examples that show how each is used. However, when you are presented with a theorem of the form ∀x(P(x) →Q(x)), which method should you use to attempt to prove it? We will provide a few rules of thumb here; in Section 1.8 we will discuss proof strategy at greater length. When you want to prove a statement of the form ∀x(P(x) →Q(x)), first evaluate whether a direct proof looks promising. Begin by expanding the definitions in the hypotheses. Start to reason using these hypotheses, together with axioms and available theorems. If a direct proof does not seem to go anywhere, for instance when there is no clear way to use hypotheses as in Examples 3 and 4 to reach the conclusion, try the same thing with a proof by contraposition. (Hypotheses such as x is irrational or x ≠0 that are difficult to reason from are a clue that an indirect proof might be your best best.) Recall that in a proof by contraposition you assume that the conclusion of the conditional statement is false and use a direct proof to show this implies that the hypothesis must be false. Often, you will find that a proof by contraposition is easily constructed from the negation of the conclusion. We illustrate this strategy in Examples 7 and 8. In each example, note how straightforward a proof by contraposition is, while there is no clear way to provide a direct proof. Before we present our next example, we need a definition.

State the THEOREM 1.,"BAYES’ THEOREM Suppose that E and F are events from a sample space S such that p(E) ≠0 and p(F) ≠0. Then p(F ∣E) = p(E ∣F)p(F) p(E ∣F)p(F) + p(E ∣F)p(F) . Proof: The definition of conditional probability tells us that p(F ∣E) = p(E ∩F)∕p(E) and p(E ∣F) = p(E ∩F)∕p(F). Therefore, p(E ∩F) = p(F ∣E)p(E) and p(E ∩F) = p(E ∣F)p(F). Equating these two expressions for p(E ∩F) shows that p(F ∣E)p(E) = p(E ∣F)p(F). Dividing both sides by p(E), we find that p(F ∣E) = p(E ∣F)p(F) p(E) . Next, we show that p(E) = p(E ∣F)p(F) + p(E ∣F)p(F). To see this, first note that E = E ∩S = E ∩(F ∪F) = (E ∩F) ∪(E ∩F). Furthermore, E ∩F and E ∩F are disjoint, because if x ∈E ∩F and x ∈E ∩F, then x ∈F ∩F = ∅. Consequently,",1.0,3.3351455

Similarly, Rn consists of those pairs (a, b) such that there are people x1, x2, ... , xn−1 such that a has met x1, x1 has met x2, ... , and xn−1 has met b.
